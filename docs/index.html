<h1 class="title">My thoughts on breathing, with an emphasis on dealing
with chronic shortness of breath</h1>
<p class="author">Issa Rice</p>
<p class="date">2024-01-24</p>
</header>
<p>THIS IS A DRAFT. THIS IS NOT PERSONALIZED MEDICAL ADVICE. USE AT YOUR
OWN RISK. (at the same time, i <em>am</em> interested in improving this
document, so if you think i am recommending something unsafe i’d like to
know about it)</p>
<h1 id="why-this-document">Why this document?</h1>
<p>I am writing basically the document I wish someone had handed to me
over a decade ago when I first started to experience shortness of
breath.</p>
<p>There’s a lot written about air hunger already. the problem is that
each source only seems to have a part of the solution. there’s no
one-stop place to get everything i need. so in some sense i’m just
synthesizing and collecting everything into one place.</p>
<p>but also, i’ve noticed a lot of sources making mistakes or not fully
explaining things. so i’ve had to think about some stuff and work it out
on my own or with friends, and also by experimenting on my own.</p>
<p>i will be critiquing a lot of sources as i discuss them. i don’t want
to sound too negative – it’s only because of all these sources that i’ve
made significant progress on overcoming my own breathing problem. but
seeing how things are explained incorrectly/what can go wrong is one of
the best ways to understand why something is the way it is. see <a
href="https://learning.subwiki.org/wiki/Importance_of_struggling_in_learning">here</a>
for more on this pedagogical perspective.</p>
<h1 id="on-ruling-out-more-serious-medical-problems">On ruling out more
serious medical problems</h1>
<p>I think as a first step, it’s a good idea to rule out any standard
problems with the lungs, by e.g. doing a chest x-ray, pulmonary function
test, etc. I will say more about what tests I got done and why. The
breathing stuff I describe later in the document <em>might</em> help
with your breathing anyway, even if you have a problem with your lungs,
but you definitely want to know if you do have problems and to get
proper treatment.</p>
<p>[TODO: add more details]</p>
<h1 id="safety">Safety</h1>
<p>I want to make two seemingly contradictory remarks about the safety
of trying various breathing techniques.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Because I am <em>already</em> experiencing significant shortness
of breath, just by breathing the way I already am, I have a greater
appetite/tolerance for air hunger and unsafe breathing. Whether I like
it or not, I am already experiencing some significant amount of risk
just by existing in my current way.</p></li>
<li><p>I have the impression that a lot of breathing coaches and such
don’t emphasize safety enough. One of the reasons I didn’t get into
Buteyko breathing earlier (despite having known about it since early
2022 or so) is that I was put off by how dangerous it seemed.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>When I started practicing silent nasal breathing, I got a few weird
symptoms including head pressure, throat tightening (it felt as if I was
being subtly choked), and possibly others. (Since I have a mysterious
chronic illness, I have a daily occurrence of weird physical symptoms,
so I am already quite used to dealing with random new symptoms, and it’s
often hard to pin down <em>why</em> a new symptom started happening, but
in the case of head pressure and throat tightening, I am pretty
confident it happens because of the breathing.)</p>
<p>The other thing I want to say about safety. It’s not helpful when
people just tell you a blanket “if you have health issues, don’t attempt
this”. Part of <em>why</em> I’m interested in fixing my breathing is
because I already have breathing and other health issues. I shouldn’t
automatically be turned away from trying to solve these issues! So, I
don’t want to <em>ignore</em> safety issues, but I also don’t want to
give useless cowardly ass-covering safety warnings. How to avoid both
problems?</p>

simple math of respiration (acid–base balance, bicarbonate buffer model,
and the Henderson–Hasselbalch equation)</h1>
<p>The aim of this section is to give you a useful mechanistic model of
how respiration works. I will skip a lot of details because while it’s
helpful to know them, they aren’t essential.</p>
<p>The central thing we’re trying to explain here is: why is it that if
you have shortness of breath, the right thing to do is the breathe
<em>less</em>, even though your body is telling you to breathe
<em>more</em>? What is going on at the chemical level when people have
shortness of breath?</p>
<p>(This is sort of like <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XliOGg8Tl98"
title="Help with air hunger - I have anxiety and feel like I can&#39;t breathe!">Howard
Cooper’s video</a> on air hunger, but there are a few things I don’t
like about his explanation, so I’m going to be writing my own ideal
version. But if you prefer a video explanation, then you can start with
the video and then come back here.)</p>
<p>What causes the urge to breathe? Humans have what are called
chemoreceptors in their brain (and some other places) that tell the body
to breathe. How do chemoreceptors know <em>when</em> to breathe? They
watch out for signals from the body, in the form of carbon dioxide
levels, oxygen levels, and blood pH. Most of the time, when people
breathe, it is because the carbon dioxide level increased above some
threshold. Oxygen only triggers breathing when it gets really low (so
low that I don’t think most humans experience it except on very rare
occasions). I think blood pH also matters, but maybe only during
exercise? (but it might matter more for air hunger; see below).</p>
<p>[argh, this is kind of hard to explain well. curse of knowledge…]</p>
<p>Okay, so CO<sub>2</sub> levels (partial pressure?) in the blood
regulate breathing. Now let’s imagine what happens when someone
overbreathes. You might think, okay, CO<sub>2</sub> goes down, so then
you don’t get as much of an urge to breathe. That’s true in the short
term. But if someone <em>chronically</em> overbreathes, then the bodies
tries to correct this. You see, the body tries very hard to keep the
blood pH at a narrow range of 7.35–7.45. If one chronically
overbreathes, then since CO<sub>2</sub> causes the blood to become
acidic, the <em>lack</em> of CO<sub>2</sub> (you’re overbreathing,
remember) causes your blood to become too alkaline. So the body
compensates by trying to make blood more acidic. How? The kidneys dump
out more bicarbonate (<span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{HCO_3^-}\)</span>) into the urine. Since
bicarbonate is alkaline, getting rid of it makes the blood more acidic.
The kidneys don’t react immediately; all this happens over the course of
hours to roughly 5 days.</p>
<p>[… some more stuff here …]</p>
<p>The important point is that because of the form of the
Henderson–Hasselbalch equation, the more CO<sub>2</sub> you have, the
less sensitive pH is to slight increases in CO<sub>2</sub>. So breath
holding for a few seconds does not cause air hunger/panic. Whereas if
your CO<sub>2</sub> is already too low (hypocapnia), then your pH is
still normal (thanks to the bicarbonate levels being adjusted by your
kidneys), but because of the low CO<sub>2</sub>, even slight changes in
CO<sub>2</sub> can cause large shifts in pH. I think it’s this increase
in pH that triggers a strong sense of air hunger. If you give in to this
urge and breathe, then your pH will be restored, so <em>temporarily</em>
you will feel better. But if you keep giving into this urge and
breathing more and more, then over time you’re shifting down your
bicarbonate buffer even more. Your body adjusts. But that means your
baseline CO<sub>2</sub> also keeps decreasing. So now you’re <em>even
more</em> sensitive to slight increases in CO<sub>2</sub>. It’s a
vicious cycle.</p>
<p>Let’s look at some numbers.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[7.4 \approx 6.1 +
\log_{10}\left(\frac{24}{0.0307 \cdot 40}\right)\]</span></p>
<p>above are the values for a normal person.</p>
<p>When I first used a capnometer, my CO<sub>2</sub> was around 25 mmHg.
So to get the same pH, my bicarbonate level must have been around
15:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[7.4 \approx 6.1 +
\log_{10}\left(\frac{15}{0.0307 \cdot 25}\right)\]</span></p>
<p>Now let’s say both individuals do a breath hold to raise their
PCO<sub>2</sub> by 5 mmHg. In the case of the healthy person, their pH
goes down to 7.34, but in the chronic overbreather’s case, it goes down
to 7.31.</p>
<p>So what we’ve established is:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you have shortness of breath with no clear medical cause, it is
likely that your CO<sub>2</sub> (and thus bicarbonate) levels are too
low.</li>
<li>Low CO<sub>2</sub> means you are more sensitive to changes in
CO<sub>2</sub>, in particular to increases in it. This is why you always
feel short of breath.</li>
<li>The solution is <em>not</em> to “take a deep breath” and get more
oxygen, but rather, to breathe <em>less</em> so that you gradually raise
your CO<sub>2</sub> levels. The emphasis is on the word “gradually”. If
you just hold your breath in the hopes of raising your CO<sub>2</sub>,
you will just give yourself a panic attack. The kidneys take time to
adjust the bicarbonate levels. So you want to sit with a
slight-to-moderate amount of air hunger, over the course of days and
weeks, so as to gradually raise your baseline CO<sub>2</sub>. How to do
this? We’ll discuss breathing techniques and breathing habits more
elsewhere in this document.</li>
</ul>
<p>What does Howard Cooper’s explanation get wrong?</p>
<ul>
<li>In the initial video, he doesn’t give any mechanism for why people
with air hunger are more sensitive to CO<sub>2</sub> buildup. He just
says that it’s like people who are sensitive to alcohol. But why does
your level of CO<sub>2</sub> affect how sensitive you are to buildup of
CO<sub>2</sub>? It’s completely mysterious.</li>
<li>In the second video, he tries to give an explanation in terms of the
bicarbonate buffer model. The problem is, in his analogy with the water
levels, <em>everything is on an additive scale</em>. The inferred
version of the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation becomes <span
class="math inline">\(-\mathrm{pH} = -\mathrm{CO_2} +
\mathrm{HCO_3^-}\)</span> (<span class="math inline">\(\text{water
level} = -\text{water leaving} + \text{water entering}\)</span>). A
healthy person and a chronic overbreather will <em>both</em> have the
same buildup of CO<sub>2</sub> when they hold their breath. So why does
the chronic overbreather have a lower Control Pause? His model can’t
explain this. You need to look at the real Henderson-Hasselbalch
equation, with the log and fraction, to understand this.</li>
</ul>
<p>more notes on howard cooper videos:</p>
<p>video 1: <a href="https://invidious.slipfox.xyz/watch?v=XliOGg8Tl98"
class="uri">https://invidious.slipfox.xyz/watch?v=XliOGg8Tl98</a></p>
<p>(why am i making such a big deal out of his videos? it’s because it’s
the first resource that really made things click for me. it’s what got
me to start doing breath pauses and nasal breathing. but it wasn’t
sufficient because it got the theory a bit wrong and also didn’t have a
good solution other than “do some breath pauses” which i now think are
not the most effective way to cure air hunger. so, i want to take the
good stuff from this video while also correcting the stuff it got
wrong.)</p>
<p>sequence/flow of the video (first person pronoun is from the
perspective of howard cooper):</p>
<ul>
<li>this video is about air hunger and anxiety</li>
<li>i personally had air hunger, and it was real bad</li>
<li>but people told me to do breathing exercises: this just made it
worse! being conscious of my breathing made it worse.</li>
<li>there is a physical cause of air hunger; it’s not in your head.</li>
<li>caveat: but make sure you get checked out by a doctor. the rest of
this video assumes you have nothing obviously wrong.</li>
<li>carbon dioxide: cells take in oxygen and release CO2. when CO2
builds up, you get an urge to breathe.</li>
<li>anxiety -&gt; overbreathing. “take deep breaths”.</li>
<li>if you have overbreathing for a long time, your CO2 levels go down.
your body makes adjustments to the low levels of CO2, and one of these
is to become very sensitive to any increase in CO2 [this is WRONG. it’s
the low level itself that makes you sensitive, not due to any
adjustment, as far as i know.]</li>
<li>alcohol tolerance analogy.</li>
<li>so what’s the cure? gradually expose yourself to more and more CO2,
so your body gets used to it.</li>
<li>“take a deep breath”: the worst advice you can give.</li>
<li>strategies for dealing with air hunger:
<ol type="1">
<li>sit with the feeling of air hunger, and do shallow breathing.</li>
<li>breathe through your nose. you can even tape your mouth. shoutout to
buteyko method.</li>
<li>control pause test introduced. [unfortunately, he doesn’t explain it
very well. in particular, he doesn’t mention that you shouldn’t breathe
any differently AFTER the test is completed. lol and he even <em>does it
wrong</em> in the video by doing an audible inhale after the test!!!]
control pause as a marker of your CO2 tolerance.</li>
<li>reduced breathing exercise: you want a manageable amount of air
hunger for “a period of time”. halve your CP, then do a breath hold for
that many seconds, take in some normal breaths, repeat. [i think buteyko
people distinguish between reduced breathing and breath holds, and this
is a breath hold exercise.] 20 second CP as a marker of normal. exercise
while reduced breathing is mentioned. anxiety also improves as CP
increases.</li>
<li>avoid ruminating. tell yourself that mild air hunger is ok.</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>
<p>video 2: <a href="https://invidious.slipfox.xyz/watch?v=RLMjvDYJL6Q"
class="uri">https://invidious.slipfox.xyz/watch?v=RLMjvDYJL6Q</a></p>
<p>sequence/flow of the video (first person pronoun is from the
perspective of howard cooper):</p>
<ul>
<li>this video is about air hunger.</li>
<li>check with doctor first.</li>
<li>CO<sub>2</sub> isn’t all bad – but doesn’t elaborate.</li>
<li>urge to breathe comes from increase in CO<sub>2</sub>.</li>
<li>The “sciencey bit”:
<ul>
<li>pH of blood is very important. so important that body will
prioritize keeping pH in a certain range over keeping you comfortable
with your breathing.</li>
<li>CO<sub>2</sub> causes blood to become acidic -&gt; carbonic acid.
the big reason your body breathes is to regulate pH.</li>
<li>water tank is analogy for pH level (it’s actually the “strength of
acid” or <span class="math inline">\(-\mathrm{pH}\)</span>). water
flowing out is CO<sub>2</sub> being breathed out; 1 tap means normal
breathing; 2 taps means you’re overbreathing. he then says a confusing
thing. he says the water coming from the sink is “a bunch of systems the
body has in place to maintain equilibrium”. i think this is wrong.
what’s going on instead is that your body produces more CO<sub>2</sub>
as part of normal metabolic functioning. so that should be what the sink
water represents. if you overbreathe, the second tap in the tank opens.
water level (acidity) starts to go down. water pitcher = bicarbonate
buffer (makes blood more acidic). actually this is the other confusing
thing in this analogy. it’s not that more bicarbonate is being dumped
into the body to make it more acidic – that would be the opposite, since
bicarbonate is alkaline. instead, the body is getting <em>rid</em> of
more bicarbonate in the urine, so as to make it <em>less</em> alkaline,
aka more acidic. the water level analogy is just too primitive to be
able to get all the signs right and i haven’t even begun to critique the
additive nature of it… But then he shows that if you turn the second tap
off, then water level goes up (because the pitcher water is still coming
in, as kidneys take time to adjust) = your blood gets more acidic, aka
you get air hunger.</li>
<li>and THEN he says, after all that, “in other words, your body becomes
hypersensitive to any increase in CO<sub>2</sub>”. this is the part that
is most wrong about this video, although i’m still a bit confused about
this. it’s true that if the overbreather holds their breath, their water
level increases faster than the normal breather’s because the pitcher is
pouring in extra water. but i think this is not what’s happening. the
other incorrect interpretation i had was that the inflow and outflow are
the same, it’s just the bicarbonate levels being different, so both the
overbreather and normal breather should have equivalent buildup of
CO<sub>2</sub> in the same amount of time, which wouldn’t explain why
the overbreather is more sensitive to that same amount of CO<sub>2</sub>
buildup. hmm so actually the water analogy may be more correct that i
thought – the chronic overbreather has to overbreathe to maintain the
pH, which means more bicarbonate has to be leaving; the bicarbonate
isn’t just a static thing, it’s also the rate that matters. BUT the
bicarbonate levels are essentially static wrt a single breath. so i’m
confused. the water analogy is wrong because it shows everything on a
similar timescale and on the same additive scale. chronic overbreathing
seems to change the bicarbonate levels to a certain extent, but then the
bicarb level settles after a while. why? ok maybe what’s going on is
that each style of breathing has an “equilibrium CO2” level that i goes
to. so my old breathing style would go to 25–30mmHg, but breathing in
this style forever wouldn’t actually lower CO2 more and more, it just
asymptotes for some reason. if that’s the case, then if you breathe like
a normal person or you hold your breath, then it’s still not because of
the bicarbonate level that you get air hunger more easily; it’s still
because of the CO<sub>2</sub> levels. so the howard cooper video is
still wrong.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>need to gradually increase CO2 levels.</li>
<li>anxiety cycle – being hyperfixated on breathing. anxiety causes you
to overbreathe, and you maintain your air hunger, and the air hunger
makes you more worried about breathing. so there’s a vicious cycle. so
need to treat both breathing and anxiety.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="is-normal-breathing-universal">Is normal breathing
universal?</h1>
<p>One of the weird things I discovered while using the CapnoTrainer is
that the breathing style that brought CO<sub>2</sub> levels up to normal
in the most effortless way turned out to be what the Buteyko people have
been saying all along: silent nasal breathing. This raises the question
of whether there is some universally “optimal” breathing style that
everyone should have, or if it’s more of a preference (different people
can have different breathing styles, but what matters is that your
CO<sub>2</sub> levels are normal and you don’t have air hunger or other
breathing issues).</p>
<p>Peter Litchfield on the other hand says that it doesn’t matter how
you breathe – you could even mouth breathe – as long as your breathing
habits are “functional” (by which I think he means your CO<sub>2</sub>
levels are at like 40 mmHg).</p>
