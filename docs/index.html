<h1 data-number="1" id="introduction"><span
class="header-section-number">1</span> Introduction</h1>
<p>maybe a better title is: overcoming chronic shortness of breath by
fixing your breathing</p>
<h2 data-number="1.1" id="why-this-document"><span
class="header-section-number">1.1</span> Why this document?</h2>
<p>there has been a lot written about breathing, both in the academic
literature and in self-help/meditation/mindfulness contexts. why am i
adding my own words to this vast literature? what value am i adding?</p>
<p>I am writing basically the document I wish someone had handed to me
over a decade ago when I first started to experience shortness of
breath.</p>
<p>There’s a lot written about air hunger already. the problem is that
each source only seems to have a part of the solution. there’s no
one-stop place to get everything i need. so in some sense i’m just
synthesizing and collecting everything into one place.</p>
<p>but also, i’ve noticed a lot of sources making mistakes or not fully
explaining things. so i’ve had to think about some stuff and work it out
on my own or with friends, and also by experimenting on my own.</p>
<p>i will be critiquing a lot of sources as i discuss them. i don’t want
to sound too negative – it’s only because of all these sources that i’ve
made significant progress on overcoming my own breathing problem. but
seeing how things are explained incorrectly/what can go wrong is one of
the best ways to understand why something is the way it is. see <a
href="https://learning.subwiki.org/wiki/Importance_of_struggling_in_learning">here</a>
for more on this pedagogical perspective.</p>
<p>note to self: this document should have a tightly focused scope. it’s
to explain what is going on biologically in air hunger, and then explain
<em>how to get out of that state</em>. all my other random thoughts
about breathing should be put somewhere else. ask: will this directly
help someone who is suffering from shortness of breath?</p>
<p>a note for breathing experts: if you’re wondering what the philosophy
of this document is in a few words, check out the <a
href="#breathing-synthesis">Breathing synthesis</a> section. In short,
my philosophy is the “Buteyko method” + the “Alexander Technique” +
capnometry biofeedback, with the first two terms in quotes because I’m
sort of doing my own bastardized versions of them, and wouldn’t want to
claim I am propagating the “real thing”. If you don’t know what any of
the three terms mean, don’t worry! They will all be explained in the
course of this document.</p>
<p>i think a lot of resources are needlessly general, to the point where
the reader has to do a lot of work to figure out which parts to ignore
and which parts to follow. trying to satisfy everyone by writing super
generally means everyone gets a decent but not great experience. so i’m
solving this problem by writing for an extremely specific audience:
people like my past self. this will make the document useless or only
tangentially relevant to a lot of people, but for the intended audience,
it will be <em>exactly</em> what they need. i’ll try to make this
document a self-contained do-it-yourself guide on how to overcome
shortness of breath.</p>
<h2 data-number="1.2" id="warningdisclaimer-and-disclosures"><span
class="header-section-number">1.2</span> Warning/disclaimer and
disclosures</h2>
<p>THIS IS A DRAFT. THIS IS NOT PERSONALIZED MEDICAL ADVICE. USE AT YOUR
OWN RISK. See the section <a href="#safety">Safety</a> below for more
details. (At the same time, I <em>am</em> interested in improving this
document, so if you think I am recommending something unsafe or I am
making some other sort of error, I’d like to know about it. Email me at
<a href="mailto:riceissa@gmail.com"
class="email">riceissa@gmail.com</a>.)</p>
<p>As for disclosures, I have nothing to disclose: I am not selling
anything. This document is freely available. I am not affiliated with
any of the products or services I recommend in this document. I don’t
use affiliate links.</p>
<p>also, while i’ve made significant progress on overcoming shortness of
breath, as of this writing i <em>still experience it daily</em>. so i
think there’s still insights i need to discover. but i think i am on the
right track in a way that i was <em>not</em> before mid-2023, so i think
at this point it makes sense to start writing things up and collecting
it all in one place, so that as i keep learning i can edit this
document. ultimate goal of this document: hopefully in a few months my
breathing will be fixed forever and this document will also completely
reflect my understanding of how i fixed it.</p>
<p>so yeah, i want to be honest that i haven’t figured it all out; i
won’t pretend i’ve figured it all out while leaving readers in the dark
feeling confused whether they’re missing something.</p>
<h2 data-number="1.3"
id="ruling-out-more-serious-medical-problems"><span
class="header-section-number">1.3</span> Ruling out more serious medical
problems</h2>
<p>I think as a first step, it’s a good idea to rule out any standard
problems with the lungs or other body organs, by e.g. doing a chest
x-ray, pulmonary function test, blood test, etc. I will say more about
what tests I got done and why. The breathing stuff I describe later in
the document <em>might</em> help with your breathing anyway, even if you
have a problem with your lungs, but you definitely want to know if you
do have problems and to get proper treatment for those before
progressing to any breathing modification.</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/G3YHBYVxxmI?t=1049"
class="uri">https://youtu.be/G3YHBYVxxmI?t=1049</a> – Chris Gilbert
lists a bunch of possible reasons for hyperventilation that
<em>aren’t</em> just anxiety/stress.</p>
<p>basically, get yourself checked out by one or more doctors, go
through the standard protocol, and if the doctors tell you that there’s
nothing wrong or that your breathing problems are just due to anxiety,
<em>then</em> come back to this document and try using the methods in
it. the only exception i’m aware of so far is asthma. if you have
asthma, then supposedly buteyko breathing is also effective, so you can
get <em>both</em> mainstream medical treatment (e.g., inhalers) and try
the things in this document (though i don’t have any first- or
second-hand experience here so you should probably just go find a
buteyko book and follow that instead).</p>
<p>[TODO: add more details]</p>
<h1 data-number="2" id="safety"><span
class="header-section-number">2</span> Safety</h1>
<p>I want to make two seemingly contradictory remarks about the safety
of trying various breathing techniques.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Because I am <em>already</em> experiencing significant shortness
of breath, just by breathing the way I already am, I have a greater
appetite/tolerance for air hunger and unsafe breathing. Whether I like
it or not, I am already experiencing some significant amount of risk
just by existing in my current way.</p></li>
<li><p>I have the impression that a lot of breathing coaches and such
don’t emphasize safety enough. One of the reasons I didn’t get into
Buteyko breathing earlier (despite having known about it since early
2022 or so) is that I was put off by how dangerous it seemed.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>When I started practicing silent nasal breathing, I got a few weird
symptoms including head pressure, throat tightening (it felt as if I was
being subtly choked), and possibly others. (Since I have a mysterious
chronic illness, I have a daily occurrence of weird physical symptoms,
so I am already quite used to dealing with random new symptoms, and it’s
often hard to pin down <em>why</em> a new symptom started happening, but
in the case of head pressure and throat tightening, I am pretty
confident it happens because of the breathing.)</p>
<p>The other thing I want to say about safety. It’s not helpful when
people just tell you a blanket “if you have health issues, don’t attempt
this”. Part of <em>why</em> I’m interested in fixing my breathing is
because I already have breathing and other health issues. I shouldn’t
automatically be turned away from trying to solve these issues! So, I
don’t want to <em>ignore</em> safety issues, but I also don’t want to
give useless cowardly ass-covering safety warnings. How to avoid both
problems?</p>
<p>i also don’t want to just put a big safety warning at the start, and
then not mention safety at all later on. safety will be a concern
throughout. but, also, i will have a safety section here to give an
overview of what you might experience.</p>
<p>because i have a lot of health anxiety i am pretty nervous to try new
things. i think a lot of buteyko people don’t have this same
orientation. like, they are in it to get superpowers or something (like
sleeping only 2 hours a day) and not out of a sense of desperation to
breathe like a normal person. so in some sense this document is like a
maximally cautious, “only in it for the health improvements”
version.</p>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="novozhilov2012">Novozhilov
(2012)</span> mentions cleansing reactions that can happen, in the
section called “Cleansing reactions”. Unfortunately it just lists a
bunch of pretty nonspecific symptoms without any guidance on what to do
about them…</p>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="novozhilov2012">Novozhilov
(2012)</span>’s main suggestion for dealing with problems seems to be
“get an expert to coach you”. i mean, sure, that’s always one solution.
but what i’m trying to do here is to write everything down so that one
can do all the steps on one’s own, as safety and effectively as
possible.</p>
<p>buteyko people also mention this, but increased sensitivity to
medications can be a thing. i used to (2024-01-07 was last time i took
it before breathing changed) be able to take 5–10 drops of methyl
factors and it would just give me a bit of energy, but now (2024-01-27)
even 1 drop of it seems to send me into irritable/uncomfortable/anxious
state. i haven’t noticed this kind of heightened sensitivity with any of
my other meds/supplements so far though. because the methyl factors
thing has only happened once so far (i’m in the middle of the episode as
i write this), it <em>could</em> be a one-time fluke, who knows.</p>
<p>i tentatively recommend going pretty slowly (need a better descriptor
here…) so that you get adjusted to the changes. i’m not sure how to go
slowly on some of the steps (e.g., when i switched from loud nasal to
silent nasal, the loud nasal just felt very unnatural so i couldn’t go
back and titrate it).</p>
<p>if you are already ill in various ways like i am, then maybe it’s not
a big deal to suffer for a while and make rapid progress. the problem is
if it’s not <em>just</em> being uncomfortable for a while, but if it
becomes permanent or if it’s a sign of actually dangerous stuff
happening. i don’t know how to distinguish what each symptom means.
hence the recommendation to go slowly.</p>
<h2 data-number="2.1" id="accidental-meditation"><span
class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Accidental meditation</h2>
<p>as you try to normalize your breath, you’re constantly paying
attention to the way you breathe, and that’s essentially the mental
motion that meditators make (at least, when they do the kind of
meditation where they focus on their breath). could you be accidentally
meditating by trying to fix your air hunger? is that why the
intracranial pressure happens? how can we correct the breath without
risking accidentally meditating? (most people might have the sense that
meditation is harmless, but my current belief is that if you do more
than like a few minutes a day, then meditation requires a lot of care to
do correctly, and you can really risk hurting yourself/disrupting your
whole life. see stuff like “dark night of the soul”. as they say about
meditation, “Better not to start. Once started, better to finish.” you
really don’t want to accidentally meditate.)</p>
<p>i don’t have any good answers yet. i’m still working through this
myself. for the head pressure, it was somewhat bad for one day, but then
after that it just got better on its own, and now i don’t notice it at
all. i’ve also been just trying to do other stuff, so that even as i do
inevitably bring my attention back to my breath to see if i’m still
doing silent nasal breathing, i’m not just sitting there doing that the
entire day.</p>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="novozhilov2012">Novozhilov
(2012)</span> even says “Exercise 1 is really another version of
meditation using the focus on breathing and relaxation of the breathing
muscles as the means for avoiding wandering thoughts.”</p>
<h2 data-number="2.2" id="coughing"><span
class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Coughing</h2>
<p>Buteyko people seem too anti-coughing to me. My uninformed guess is
that it’s good to cough sometimes, e.g., to clear mucus or during a
viral infection. Then there are other more mysterious forms of cough
(e.g., twice in my life for like a month each, I had a habit of little
micro-coughs/chest itchy feeling) where I think suppressing the cough is
more justified (the second time it happened, doing soft breathing to

of breath</h1>
<p>If you followed my advice and ruled out serious medical problems with
a doctor, you may be thinking there is no biological cause of your
shortness of breath, that it is just all “in your head”. Certainly this
is what doctors kept telling <em>me</em>, that it was all due to anxiety
or some other hard-to-verify physical cause like mast cell activation
(primary care physician, two pulmonologists, allergist).</p>
<p>It turns out that there is a pretty well-understood cause of air
hunger! But to understand it, we need to have a decent understanding of
the chemistry of respiration; in particular we’ll need to correct some
misconceptions about breathing. So that’s what this section is
about.</p>
<p>The aim of this section is to give you a useful mechanistic model of
how respiration works. I will skip a lot of details because while it’s
helpful to know them, they aren’t essential.</p>
<p>The central thing we’re trying to explain here is: why is it that if
you have shortness of breath, the right thing to do is the breathe
<em>less</em>, even though your body is telling you to breathe
<em>more</em>? What is going on at the chemical level when people have
shortness of breath?</p>
<p>(This is sort of like <span class="citation"
data-cites="cooper2021">Cooper (2021)</span> on air hunger, but there
are a few things I don’t like about his explanation, so I’m going to be
writing my own ideal version. But if you prefer a video explanation,
then you can start with the video and then come back here.)</p>

<p>The chemistry of respiration</p>
<p>What causes the urge to breathe? Humans have what are called
chemoreceptors in their brain (and some other places) that tell the body
to breathe. How do chemoreceptors know <em>when</em> to breathe? They
watch out for signals from the body, in the form of carbon dioxide
levels, oxygen levels, and blood pH. Most of the time, when people
breathe, it is because the carbon dioxide level increased above some
threshold. Oxygen only triggers breathing when it gets really low (so
low that I don’t think most humans experience it except on very rare
occasions). I think blood pH also matters, but maybe only during
exercise? (but it might matter more for air hunger; see below).</p>
<p>i’m not very attached to “high levels of CO2 are super healthy”. i
honestly haven’t vetted the claims. but basically everyone (including
mainstream western medicine) agrees that 35–45 mmHg is the healthy range
for partial pressure of CO<sub>2</sub>.</p>

((TODO:
Vipul says "Regarding the Henderson-Hasselbach, I think you can maybe give a TL;DR version where you say that chemical equilibrium works multiplicatively (in proportional terms) on concentrations, which is why the sensitivity to additional CO2 is proportional to the level of CO2.
I mean, it's not a full explanation, but for those who vaguely remember equilibrium from high school or college chemistry, that should be enough to make it click
(You should also include the fuller explanation, but at least people have a tagline to fall back to)
and use the word _proportional_
Rather than just 'when it's lower it's more sensitive'
though I think ultimately it may not be strictly proportional, at least that is the first-pass intuition we're drawing on
(and plugging in the Henderson-Hasselbach also yields proportionality)"

also derive the -(Change in pH) = log_10(ratio of PCO_2) = log_10(1 + (change in PCO_2)/(original PCO_2)) equation that vipul came up with.

<p>[argh, this is kind of hard to explain well. curse of knowledge…]</p>
<p>Okay, so CO<sub>2</sub> levels (partial pressure?) in the blood
regulate breathing. Now let’s imagine what happens when someone
overbreathes. You might think, okay, CO<sub>2</sub> goes down, so then
you don’t get as much of an urge to breathe. That’s true in the short
term. But if someone <em>chronically</em> overbreathes, then the bodies
tries to correct this. You see, the body tries very hard to keep the
blood pH at a narrow range of 7.35–7.45. If one chronically
overbreathes, then since CO<sub>2</sub> causes the blood to become
acidic, the <em>lack</em> of CO<sub>2</sub> (you’re overbreathing,
remember) causes your blood to become too alkaline. So the body
compensates by trying to make blood more acidic. How? The kidneys dump
out more bicarbonate (<span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{HCO_3^-}\)</span>) into the urine. Since
bicarbonate is alkaline, getting rid of it makes the blood more acidic.
The kidneys don’t react immediately; all this happens over the course of
hours to roughly 5 days.</p>
<p>[… some more stuff here …]</p>
<p>The important point is that because of the form of the
Henderson–Hasselbalch equation, the more CO<sub>2</sub> you have, the
less sensitive pH is to slight increases in CO<sub>2</sub>. So breath
holding for a few seconds does not cause air hunger/panic/suffocation.
Whereas if your CO<sub>2</sub> is already too low (hypocapnia), then
your pH is still normal (thanks to the bicarbonate levels being adjusted
by your kidneys), but because of the low CO<sub>2</sub>, even slight
changes in CO<sub>2</sub> can cause large shifts in pH. I think it’s
this decrease in pH (when CO<sub>2</sub> rises, blood becomes more
acidic so pH goes down) that triggers a strong sense of air hunger. If
you give in to this urge and breathe, then your pH will be restored, so
<em>temporarily</em> you will feel better. But if you keep giving into
this urge and breathing more and more, then over time you’re shifting
down your bicarbonate buffer even more. Your body adjusts. But that
means your baseline CO<sub>2</sub> also keeps decreasing. So now you’re
<em>even more</em> sensitive to slight increases in CO<sub>2</sub>. It’s
a vicious cycle. (and this isn’t even talking about the negative health
effects of low CO<sub>2</sub>.)</p>
<p>Let’s look at some numbers.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[7.4 \approx 6.1 +
\log_{10}\left(\frac{24}{0.0307 \cdot 40}\right)\]</span></p>
<p>above are the values for a normal person.</p>
<p>When I first used a capnometer, my CO<sub>2</sub> was around 25 mmHg.
So to get the same pH, my bicarbonate level must have been around 15
(here I’m basically solving for the equation <span
class="math inline">\(24/40 = x/25\)</span>):</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[7.4 \approx 6.1 +
\log_{10}\left(\frac{15}{0.0307 \cdot 25}\right)\]</span></p>
<p>Now let’s say both individuals do a breath hold to raise their
PCO<sub>2</sub> by 5 mmHg. In the case of the healthy person, their pH
goes down to 7.34, but in the chronic overbreather’s case, it goes down
to 7.31.</p>
<p>here’s the other thing vipul showed me:</p>
<p>suppose your equation right now is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
  \mathrm{pH} &amp;\approx 6.1 +
\log_{10}\left(\frac{\mathrm{[HCO_3^-]}}{0.0307 \cdot
p\mathrm{CO_2}}\right) \\
              &amp;= 6.1 + \log_{10}(\mathrm{[HCO_3^-]}) -
\log_{10}(0.0307) - \log_{10}(p\mathrm{CO_2})
\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>Now you hold your breath so that the <em>p</em>CO<sub>2</sub> goes up
by some amount, <span class="math inline">\(\Delta
p\mathrm{CO_2}\)</span>, and the pH changes by some amount, <span
class="math inline">\(\Delta \mathrm{pH}\)</span> (it’s a negative
quantity, since your pH goes down when the blood becomes more acidic).
Your equation now looks like:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
  \mathrm{pH} + \Delta \mathrm{pH} &amp;\approx 6.1 +
\log_{10}\left(\frac{\mathrm{[HCO_3^-]}}{0.0307 \cdot (p\mathrm{CO_2} +
\Delta p\mathrm{CO_2})}\right) \\
                                   &amp;= 6.1 +
\log_{10}(\mathrm{[HCO_3^-]}) - \log_{10}(0.0307) -
\log_{10}(p\mathrm{CO_2} + \Delta p\mathrm{CO_2})
\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>Now let’s subtract the first equation from the second; we get:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
  \Delta \mathrm{pH} &amp;= \log_{10}(p\mathrm{CO_2}) -
\log_{10}(p\mathrm{CO_2} + \Delta p\mathrm{CO_2}) \\
                     &amp;=
\log_{10}\left(\frac{p\mathrm{CO_2}}{p\mathrm{CO_2} + \Delta
p\mathrm{CO_2}}\right) \\
                     &amp;= - \log_{10}\left(1 + \frac{\Delta
p\mathrm{CO_2}}{p\mathrm{CO_2}}\right)
\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>What does all of this show? Well, the quantity <span
class="math inline">\(\frac{\Delta
p\mathrm{CO_2}}{p\mathrm{CO_2}}\)</span> is actually the percentage
change in pCO<sub>2</sub>. So it shows that <em>the change in pH is a
function of the percentage change in pCO<sub>2</sub></em>. This is one
way to understand why having low CO<sub>2</sub> means your pH changes
more easily: the same amount of absolute CO<sub>2</sub> change results
in a greater percentage change in CO<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p>for advanced buteyko practitioners however, my current guess is that
their PCO<sub>2</sub> levels are normal (40–45 mmHg). so now, how do we
explain how they can hold their breaths for so long? i think some other
factors are at play here including:</p>
<ul>
<li>less sensitive chemoreceptors</li>
<li>hemoglobin count or efficiency</li>
<li>myoglobin count or efficiency</li>
<li>reduced or more efficient cellular metabolism (slower rate of
generation of CO2)</li>
<li>higher lung capacity</li>
</ul>
<p>some of the above may also be happening in going from chronic
overbreather to normal breather, but it’s not obviously necessary to
explain the differences in CO<sub>2</sub> tolerance between overbreather
and normal.</p>
<h2 data-number="3.4" id="summary"><span
class="header-section-number">3.4</span> Summary</h2>
<p>So what we’ve established is:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you have shortness of breath with no clear medical cause, it is
likely that your CO<sub>2</sub> level (and thus bicarbonate level) is
too low.</li>
<li>Low CO<sub>2</sub> means you are more sensitive to changes in
CO<sub>2</sub>, in particular to increases in it. This is why you always
feel short of breath.</li>
<li>The solution is <em>not</em> to “take a deep breath” and get more
oxygen, but rather, to breathe <em>less</em> so that you
<em>gradually</em> raise your CO<sub>2</sub> levels. The emphasis is on
the word “gradually”. If you just hold your breath as long as possible
in the hopes of raising your CO<sub>2</sub>, you will just give yourself
a panic attack. The kidneys take time to adjust the bicarbonate levels.
So you want to sit with a slight-to-moderate amount of air hunger, over
the course of days and weeks, so as to gradually raise your baseline
CO<sub>2</sub>. How to do this? We’ll discuss breathing techniques and
breathing habits more elsewhere in this document.</li>

<h2 data-number="3.5" id="analysis-of-howard-cooper-videos"><span
class="header-section-number">3.5</span> Analysis of Howard Cooper
videos</h2>
<p>honestly this section might be <em>way</em> too much detail for most
readers, so you can skip it on a first read (or entirely) if you want.
i’m only very passionate about this topic because it took me so long to
understand what was going on. i might actually move out this whole
section into a separate document because i don’t think most people will
care.</p>
<p>What does Howard Cooper’s explanation get wrong?</p>
<ul>
<li>In the initial video, he doesn’t give any mechanism for why people
with air hunger are more sensitive to CO<sub>2</sub> buildup. He just
says that it’s like people who are sensitive to alcohol. But why does
your level of CO<sub>2</sub> affect how sensitive you are to buildup of
CO<sub>2</sub>? It’s completely mysterious.</li>
<li>In the second video, he tries to give an explanation in terms of the
bicarbonate buffer model. The problem is, in his analogy with the water
levels, <em>everything is on an additive scale</em>. The inferred
version of the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation becomes <span
class="math inline">\(-\mathrm{pH} = -\mathrm{CO_2} +
\mathrm{HCO_3^-}\)</span> (<span class="math inline">\(\text{water
level} = -\text{water leaving} + \text{water entering}\)</span>). A
healthy person and a chronic overbreather will <em>both</em> have the
same buildup of CO<sub>2</sub> when they hold their breath. So why does
the chronic overbreather have a lower Control Pause? His model can’t
explain this. You need to look at the real Henderson-Hasselbalch
equation, with the log and fraction, to understand this.</li>
</ul>
<p>more notes on howard cooper videos:</p>
<p>video 1: <span class="citation" data-cites="cooper2021">(Cooper

<p>(why am i making such a big deal out of his videos? it’s because it’s
the first resource that really made things click for me. it’s what got
me to start doing breath pauses and nasal breathing. but it wasn’t
sufficient because it got the theory a bit wrong and also didn’t have a
good solution other than “do some breath pauses” which i now think are
not the most effective way to cure air hunger. so, i want to take the
good stuff from this video while also correcting the stuff it got
wrong.)</p>
<p>sequence/flow of the video:</p>
<ul>
<li>this video is about air hunger and anxiety</li>
<li>cooper personally had air hunger, and it was real bad</li>
<li>but people told cooper to do breathing exercises: this just made it
worse! being conscious of his breathing made it worse.</li>
<li>there is a physical cause of air hunger; it’s not in your head.</li>
<li>caveat: but make sure you get checked out by a doctor. the rest of
this video assumes you have nothing obviously wrong.</li>
<li>carbon dioxide: cells take in oxygen and release CO2. when CO2
builds up, you get an urge to breathe.</li>
<li>anxiety -&gt; overbreathing. “take deep breaths”.</li>
<li>if you have overbreathing for a long time, your CO2 levels go down.
your body makes adjustments to the low levels of CO2, and one of these
is to become very sensitive to any increase in CO2 [this is WRONG. it’s
the low level itself that makes you sensitive, not due to any
adjustment, as far as i know.]</li>
<li>alcohol tolerance analogy.</li>
<li>so what’s the cure? gradually expose yourself to more and more CO2,
so your body gets used to it.</li>
<li>“take a deep breath”: the worst advice you can give.</li>
<li>strategies for dealing with air hunger:
<ol type="1">
<li>sit with the feeling of air hunger, and do shallow breathing.</li>
<li>breathe through your nose. you can even tape your mouth. shoutout to
buteyko method.</li>
<li>control pause test introduced. [unfortunately, he doesn’t explain it
very well. in particular, he doesn’t mention that you shouldn’t breathe
any differently AFTER the test is completed. lol and he even <em>does it
wrong</em> in the video by doing an audible inhale after the test!!!]
control pause as a marker of your CO2 tolerance.</li>
<li>reduced breathing exercise: you want a manageable amount of air
hunger for “a period of time”. halve your CP, then do a breath hold for
that many seconds, take in some normal breaths, repeat. [i think buteyko
people distinguish between reduced breathing and breath holds, and this
is a breath hold exercise.] 20 second CP as a marker of normal. exercise
while reduced breathing is mentioned. anxiety also improves as CP
increases.</li>
<li>avoid ruminating. tell yourself that mild air hunger is ok.</li>

<p>sequence/flow of the video:</p>
<ul>
<li>this video is about air hunger.</li>
<li>check with doctor first.</li>
<li>CO<sub>2</sub> isn’t all bad – but doesn’t elaborate.</li>
<li>urge to breathe comes from increase in CO<sub>2</sub>.</li>
<li>The “sciencey bit”:
<ul>
<li>pH of blood is very important. so important that body will
prioritize keeping pH in a certain range over keeping you comfortable
with your breathing.</li>
<li>CO<sub>2</sub> causes blood to become acidic -&gt; carbonic acid.
the big reason your body breathes is to regulate pH.</li>
<li>water tank is analogy for pH level (it’s actually the “strength of
acid” or <span class="math inline">\(-\mathrm{pH}\)</span>). water
flowing out is CO<sub>2</sub> being breathed out; 1 tap means normal
breathing; 2 taps means you’re overbreathing. he then says a confusing
thing. he says the water coming from the sink is “a bunch of systems the
body has in place to maintain equilibrium”. i think this is wrong.
what’s going on instead is that your body produces more CO<sub>2</sub>
as part of normal metabolic functioning. so that should be what the sink
water represents. if you overbreathe, the second tap in the tank opens.
water level (acidity) starts to go down. water pitcher = bicarbonate
buffer (makes blood more acidic). actually this is the other confusing
thing in this analogy. it’s not that more bicarbonate is being dumped
into the body to make it more acidic – that would be the opposite, since
bicarbonate is alkaline. instead, the body is getting <em>rid</em> of
more bicarbonate in the urine, so as to make it <em>less</em> alkaline,
aka more acidic. the water level analogy is just too primitive to be
able to get all the signs right and i haven’t even begun to critique the
additive nature of it… But then he shows that if you turn the second tap
off, then water level goes up (because the pitcher water is still coming
in, as kidneys take time to adjust) = your blood gets more acidic, aka
you get air hunger.</li>
<li>and THEN he says, after all that, “in other words, your body becomes
hypersensitive to any increase in CO<sub>2</sub>”. this is the part that
is most wrong about this video, although i’m still a bit confused about
this. it’s true that if the overbreather holds their breath, their water
level increases faster than the normal breather’s because the pitcher is
pouring in extra water. but i think this is not what’s happening. the
other incorrect interpretation i had was that the inflow and outflow are
the same, it’s just the bicarbonate levels being different, so both the
overbreather and normal breather should have equivalent buildup of
CO<sub>2</sub> in the same amount of time, which wouldn’t explain why
the overbreather is more sensitive to that same amount of CO<sub>2</sub>
buildup. hmm so actually the water analogy may be more correct that i
thought – the chronic overbreather has to overbreathe to maintain the
pH, which means more bicarbonate has to be leaving; the bicarbonate
isn’t just a static thing, it’s also the rate that matters. BUT the
bicarbonate levels are essentially static wrt a single breath. so i’m
confused. the water analogy is wrong because it shows everything on a
similar timescale and on the same additive scale. chronic overbreathing
seems to change the bicarbonate levels to a certain extent, but then the
bicarb level settles after a while. why? ok maybe what’s going on is
that each style of breathing has an “equilibrium CO2” level that i goes
to. so my old breathing style would go to 25–30mmHg, but breathing in
this style forever wouldn’t actually lower CO2 more and more, it just
asymptotes for some reason. if that’s the case, then if you breathe like
a normal person or you hold your breath, then it’s still not because of
the bicarbonate level that you get air hunger more easily; it’s still
because of the CO<sub>2</sub> levels. so the howard cooper video is
still wrong.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>need to gradually increase CO2 levels.</li>
<li>anxiety cycle – being hyperfixated on breathing. anxiety causes you
to overbreathe, and you maintain your air hunger, and the air hunger
makes you more worried about breathing. so there’s a vicious cycle. so
need to treat both breathing and anxiety.</li>

id="is-healthy-breathing-the-same-for-everyoneis-normal-breathing-universal"><span
class="header-section-number">4</span> Is healthy breathing the same for
everyone?/Is normal breathing universal?</h1>
<p>One of the weird things I discovered while using the CapnoTrainer is
that the breathing style that brought CO<sub>2</sub> levels up to normal
in the most effortless way turned out to be what the Buteyko people have
been saying all along: silent nasal breathing. This raises the question
of whether there is some universally “optimal” breathing style that
everyone should have, or if it’s more of a preference (different people
can have different breathing styles, but what matters is that your
CO<sub>2</sub> levels are normal and you don’t have air hunger or other
breathing issues).</p>
<p>Peter Litchfield on the other hand says that it doesn’t matter how
you breathe – you could even mouth breathe – as long as your breathing
habits are “functional” (by which I think he means your CO<sub>2</sub>
levels are at like 40 mmHg).</p>
<h1 data-number="5"

class="header-section-number">5</span> Can you overshoot your
CO<sub>2</sub> levels by doing too much reduced breathing?</h1>
<p>so you combat air hunger by breathing less, which raises
CO<sub>2</sub>. what if you just keep going? could you be overshooting
and getting <em>hypercapnia</em> instead?</p>
<p>Here’s a heuristic argument for why this shouldn’t happen: even
people who overbreathe don’t overbreathe so much that their
CO<sub>2</sub> just keeps dropping indefinitely. Each style of breathing
seems to asymptote at a certain point. So I think Buteyko-style reduced
breathing also asymptotes in terms of CO<sub>2</sub> levels.</p>
<p>But also, I think there must be some other effect going on, because I
don’t think the Buteyko people have abnormally high CO<sub>2</sub>
(that’s just my current guess).</p>
<p>the main lesson here is that having a capnometer is quite useful, to
give the assurance that your CO<sub>2</sub> levels are normal.</p>

<h1 data-number="7"
id="sequence-of-cumulative-constraints-of-breathing-practice"><span
class="header-section-number">7</span> Sequence of cumulative
constraints of breathing practice</h1>
<p>I think it may be helpful to conceptualize breathing practice<a
href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> not as a set of “breathing
techniques” that you practice over time to help calm you down or
whatever (such as: “when you’re feeling anxious, do square breathing;
once you feel comfortable with that, you can move onto different
patterns like 4-7-8”), but instead as a <em>sequence of cumulative
constraints</em>. The reason for having a <em>sequence</em> is that it’s
too hard to pay attention to the more subtle stuff and get it right all
on the first try before you get the basics down; each stage might take a
month or more. (The other reason for this particular sequence: if you
follow the sequence, then by doing the previous steps, you automatically
almost do the next stage, so that at each stage you only need to put in
a <em>little</em> bit of effort, not invent a whole new thing.) The
reason for having <em>constraints</em> rather than practices is that it
mostly doesn’t matter <em>how</em> you achieve good breathing, you just
want the outcome.</p>
<p>This page used to use the phrase “sequence of moving targets” rather
than “sequence of cumulative constraints”, but I renamed this page
because I thought the new version is a more accurate phrasing. Like the
Gram–Schmidt process in linear algebra the constraints are cumulative
(at each step <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, you want to make
sure that the new vector you create is orthogonal not just to the <span
class="math inline">\((n-1)\)</span>th vector, but to <em>all</em> the
vectors <span class="math inline">\(1, \dots, n-1\)</span>. This kind of
mechanic also happens a lot in puzzle games where if you get one thing
in a “good” state, and then try to get another thing in a “good” state,
the first one will turn back into a “bad” state, and the difficulty of
the puzzle is to make sure you can get all the good states
cumulatively). Also “constraint” feels more accurate than “target”
because you’re not trying to hit some new breathing pattern some of the
time, but rather you’re trying to <em>only</em> do the “good” kind of
breathing <em>all</em> of the time.</p>
<h2 data-number="7.1" id="the-sequence"><span
class="header-section-number">7.1</span> The sequence</h2>
<p>Here is the sequence I am thinking of:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Initially, because I was still mouth-breathing a significant
percentage of the time (20%?), my constraint was to do nasal breathing.
<em>Any</em> nasal breathing. The goal was simply to get away from the
habit of mouth breathing. Nasal breathing is a good first target because
(a) it’s extremely obvious whether any particular breath happens through
the nose or mouth; and (b) on its own it already has pretty dramatic
effects (see <span class="citation" data-cites="nestor2020">Nestor
(2020)</span> for a lot more detail on this). Achieving nose breathing
itself occurs in two stages:
<ul>
<li>Consciously do nasal breathing. You use any and all tools you have
to try to nose breathe: just anxiously paying attention all the time,
nasal strips, nose cones, azelastine, NeilMed, allergy sheets, etc.
(Flonase is another option that <em>might</em> help people but it didn’t
work for me because of side-effects and there’s a chance it builds up a
dependence even though it’s not supposed to?) You want to get to a point
where the only times you mouth breathe are when you have to blow your
nose, when you swim, when you take a shower, or things like that. I nose
breathe even with a mask on, even when I’m brushing my teeth, and as
much as possible even in my sleep (mouth taping might help with this).
(This step took around 1 month for me.)</li>
<li>Eventually, it becomes automatic, and you won’t even need the
training wheels. (After a month, my nasal breathing became
habitual/automatic. I remained at this stage for the next 4 months or
so, not because I wanted to but because I wasn’t sure what to do
next.)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Next stage: silence your breath.
<ul>
<li>Same two stages here (conscious/manual techniques, then
unconscious/automatic habit). Silent breath is the next constraint
because it’s also easy to detect: it means you can’t hear your own
breath at all (neither inhale nor exhale). Silent breath. At least when
you’re just sitting or standing. I’m not sure how feasible it is yet to
have a silent breath while exercising. (This stage took about a week
once I got the CapnoTrainer, though arguably it’s still ongoing. In
particular, there was a 24 hour period where I had a kind of epiphany
and figured out how to do this right.)</li>
<li>As with the nose breathing stage, you don’t have to get it to be
perfect. Sometimes, breathing in a silent way can make your diaphragm or
your throat hurt. I think this happens because you’re manually trying to
control those muscles too hard by tensing them up in the wrong ways. If
that’s the case, you can try for a while to just make a bit of noise
when breathing, just like you might still have “rescue breaths” through
your mouth sometimes.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Next stage: smooth your breath.
<ul>
<li>Even when your breath is through the nose and silent, it can be
“jagged” on the CapnoTrainer. It can even <em>feel</em> jagged to you,
like you’re manually forcing air out in little bursts, instead of it
just flowing out like it should. I don’t know how to fix this one yet,
but it seems harder to notice and harder to fix, so that’s why it comes
later. But the idea, at least for the exhale, is to just try to let go
of the breath and naturally let your diaphragm relax. It should feel
like your body is just relaxing, instead of exhaling (even though of
course you are also exhaling). As I said, I’m still experimenting with
this one.</li>
<li>This one is tricky because I notice that as I try to do it my
diaphragm can get sore if I do it wrong. In particular, it can sometimes
help to break the “silent” rule in order to get the breath smoother.
There’s a distinction between breathing in a way so that you aren’t
hypocapnic, and breathing in a way that is comfortable and not painful
to your body. Every combination is possible.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Next stage: slow down your breath.
<ul>
<li>Your breath should already be slower if it’s more quiet and smooth.
But when you’re trying to make it quiet or smooth, you don’t want to
focus on slowing it down … that just makes you uncomfortable because
you’re not used to that much air hunger. But once your breath is silent
and smooth, it’s time to focus on slowing it down. I still haven’t
gotten to this stage so I don’t know how slow is optimal. I suspect this
is the point where an HRV monitor or such would be handy: there might be
individual variation in the optimal rate. Notice how it’s much harder to
say what “slow breath” is compared to “nasal breath” or “silent breath”
or “smooth breath”, and it is much harder to track without an instrument
like a capnometer (counting in your head all the time seems
annoying!).</li>
<li>UPDATE (2024-01-26): i am thinking more and more that slowing your
breath is unnecessary; it’s like the diaphragm thing and it
automatically happens. i think some of the buteyko people also say the
same thing. e.g. see <span class="citation"
data-cites="novozhilov2012">Novozhilov (2012)</span>; in the section
“Approach 3 – Just hint at reduction of airflow” there is an
illustration of a snake where slowing down the breath is a sign of doing
the exercise wrong. Under mistakes, he lists “Increasing the frequency
of your breathing or changing the length of inhalation or
exhalation.”</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>Note that the above is essentially (some of the particular techniques
taught in) Buteyko breathing. The differences are: (1) pedagogical, in
that I think focusing on each step in sequence works a lot better, and
(2) whether to use a CapnoTrainer to help with some of the steps.</p>
<h2 data-number="7.2" id="any-more-stages"><span
class="header-section-number">7.2</span> Any more stages?</h2>
<p>upper chest (intercostals) vs diaphragm? i feel like this one happens
automatically by doing the ones above. But for some reason this is like
the focus of many breathing gurus/meditation experts. but it’s not
necessary! in fact, i think it can be harmful to focus on your diaphragm
too much – it leads to exaggerated/forceful movement of it which can
cause overbreathing/sore muscles. like, sure, it’s fine to check your
abdomen to see that you are generally breathing with your diaphragm more
than upper chest, but it shouldn’t be a target.</p>
<h1 data-number="8" id="clearing-your-nose"><span
class="header-section-number">8</span> Clearing your nose</h1>
<p>In my view, nasal breathing is essential for overcoming shortness of
breath. It’s also the very first step. There’s a lot of strategies here
so I’ll list a bunch along with what I think of them. My guess is that
different ones will work for different people, so you kind of want to
try a bunch and see what works (most of these are quite cheap).</p>
<p>I won’t say much about <em>why</em> it’s better to breathe through
your nose, as I think this is already covered pretty well in other
sources, in particular <span class="citation"
data-cites="nestor2020">Nestor (2020)</span>, which gives a pretty vivid
description of the author’s own experiment of breathing solely through
his mouth (it’s scattered throughout the book, so unfortunately I can’t
cite a specific chapter).</p>
<p>I think there are two broad ways you can react to “you need to clear
your nose”. One of them will be to say “Yeah, I hardly ever breathe
through my nose; I know I need to work on it but I don’t know how”. The
other is to say “I already breathe through my nose; I don’t think I need
any advice”. For this second type of person I want to mention my own
anecdote. Before I started really focusing on my breath, I used to think
I was already a nasal breather, but when I started paying attention I
realized that I was actually taking quite a few mouth breaths throughout
the day. A sure way to find out is to tape your mouth during the day
(even for just 15 minutes or so) and see how easy it is for you. I think
I probably went from around 80% nose breaths to 99.9% nose breaths by
following the strategies listed below (just a wild guess unfortunately
because I didn’t keep good records); during breathing attacks, I
probably went from 10–50% nose breaths to 95% nose breaths. So if you
already think you are a nasal breather, I would still try paying
attention.</p>
<p>Now, here are the main strategies I recommend for clearing your nose
so you can nose breathe more:</p>
<ul>
<li>Saline spray: works less well than the saline wash, but it’s a lot
less unpleasant. it doesn’t go “deep” enough, which is why it is both
less painful and doesn’t work as well. i went through about 1.5 bottles
of the NeilMed one (lime green color bottle) before my nose improved
enough that I didn’t need to use it anymore.</li>
<li>Saline wash/netipot: tried this once. it works really well for
clearing your nose, but it was also quite unpleasant. make sure to never
use tap water for this.</li>
<li>Nose strips: these were quite helpful. at first i used the RiteAid
brand ones and they worked well enough, and then i got cheaper ones from
Amazon and those also worked fine. so my guess is that there isn’t much
of a quality difference between different brands, and you can just go
with whatever. the main thing to watch for is that your skin should not
get irritated from using them. also, you should <em>immediately</em>
notice an improvement. if you don’t immediately breathe better, then
you’re either not putting them on right or the thing isn’t working.
There is also a magnetic strip made by a company called Intake
Breathing. I never used it so I don’t know how well it works, but if you
can’t get regular nose strips to work, you can look into this.</li>
<li>Nose cones: these didn’t work for me (i got them because i was
encouraged by how useful the nose strips were, and cones seemed like
reusable strips). they don’t go deep enough in the nose, so they really
only help i think if you have a deviated septum or something…</li>
<li>Patrick McKeown’s nose unblocking exercise: this is one where you
pinch your nose while holding your breath, and swaying or walking around
as you do that. I tried this back when my nose was stuffier, and it
didn’t work very well for me, but i also didn’t try very hard to get it
working (i just followed one of his videos).</li>
<li>Antihistamine spray (e.g., azelastine): my guess is azelastine did
nothing for me. but maybe it helped a bit with reducing mucus producing
during the night. i never tried olopatadine (the more famous
antihistamine nasal spray) because my insurance doesn’t cover it.</li>
<li>Steroid spray (e.g. Flonase): i would stay away from these, unless
you already know they work well for you. definitely try all the other
ones in the list first. note that there are different kinds of steroid
sprays and some of them are <em>very</em> bad to keep using long-term.
Flonase is supposed to be one of the safer kinds, but i only used it
once so i can’t speak to any longer-term effects.</li>
</ul>
<p>Important note: as you start breathing through your nose more, you
should find that your nose becomes less blocked even without doing these
things. I used to need the nose strips <em>a lot</em> when I first
started nasal breathing. But now I hardly need them. So these techniques
should be thought of as temporary crutches – or like training wheels on
a bicycle. They are there to help jump start your nasal breathing until
your nose is strong enough, but you shouldn’t need them forever. I had a
clear shift when I first switched to nasal breathing, and then a second
shift when I switched to <em>silent</em> nasal breathing. It seems odd
that my nose would clear up with <em>less</em> air moving through the
nose. My hypothesis is that either my health in general got better, or
maybe less air means less irritation.</p>
<p>Definitely don’t get surgery, unless you’ve tried all the safe
options and nothing works. I think the mainstream medical world
understates the risks here, e.g., you should read about empty nose
syndrome. <span class="citation" data-cites="nestor2020">Nestor
(2020)</span> has a bit about this. See also <span class="citation"
data-cites="sager2024">Sager (2024)</span> for a random encouraging
anecdote that I came across on Twitter.</p>
<p>i should say something about mouth taping as well. i don’t have any
<em>strong</em> argument again it, but i have personally not done it. as
you improve your breathing, you mouth should automatically close. so
mouth taping is, in my view, unnecessary in the long-term. what about
the short term? after all, all the other nose-unblocking stuff i’m
recommending are short-term crutches as well. i think in the short term
maybe it’s completely fine? i was just personally scared of using it,
and never needed it.</p>
<p>my nose still sometimes feels unblocked in the morning. not sure
what’s going on there.</p>
<h1 data-number="9"
id="the-unreasonable-effectiveness-of-capnometers"><span
class="header-section-number">9</span> The unreasonable effectiveness of
capnometers</h1>
<p>One might naively expect that capnometers would be useless, since
they don’t actually <em>do</em> anything to your breathing. All of the
breathing changes you make are ones you make yourself, and the
capnometer just tells you what your CO<sub>2</sub> levels are without
affecting them. One might thus conclude that capnometers are useless. I
don’t have a great reply to this – in fact, some people seem to get
better just by doing Buteyko breathing “blind” (i.e., without seeing
their breathing curve using a capnometer). So clearly it <em>is</em>
possible to do the same things without a capnometer. (Even Peter
Litchfield admits this to some extent.<a href="#fn2"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>)
But in my case, it was only after I got a capnometer that I saw rapid
progress. Here I will try to build a model of <em>why</em> having a
capnometer is so useful.</p>
<p>My model of why capnometers are so “unreasonably effective” is
basically that with Buteyko breathing, part of the problem is that even
if you make progress, you can never know if you’re pushing so hard that
you’ve overshot your CO<sub>2</sub> and are now having too much CO2. You
can’t really avoid this problem because both too low CO<sub>2</sub> and
too high CO<sub>2</sub> feel pretty much exactly the same – air hunger.
So a capnometer is what actually lets you know for sure whether you are
undershooting, just right, or overshooting.</p>
<p>It’s just super helpful to <em>see</em> what your breath looks like.
Buteyko breathing can feel <em>scary</em> because you don’t know if
you’re going too hard and might be harming yourself. Hooking yourself up
to a capnometer tells you whether your CO<sub>2</sub> levels are
normal.</p>
<p>one of the things i’m still trying to figure out is, supposedly
Konstantin Buteyko originally had various machines to measure
CO<sub>2</sub> or whatever, but then they were destroyed, so then he was
forced to come up with the Control Pause as the sort of replacement
metric. but what i’m wondering is, what did his machines measure? was it
just end-tidal CO<sub>2</sub>? and if so, then what did he do after
people reached a normal 40 mmHg of pCO<sub>2</sub>? was that the end of
treatment? or did he try to push the CO<sub>2</sub> even higher?</p>
<h1 data-number="10" id="capnometry-biofeedback"><span
class="header-section-number">10</span> Capnometry biofeedback</h1>
<!--

From Vipul: """btw I'd love for you to expand more on what capnometers measure, particularly this related cluster of ideas:

(1) "end tidal CO2 is interesting only insofar as it approximates your alveolar CO2 -- it's not intended to be a reflection of the nature of that particular outbreath"
(2) "end tidal CO2 should be measured as of the end of a normal outbreath, as 'tidal' refers to normal breathing"
(3) "you can fake getting a high reading by forcefully breathing out more but that's just cheating, because by the time you're on your outbreath, the 'correct' reading for that outbreath is already predetermined"
"""
-->
<p>[TODO: fill out this section. It should be about how to use the
capnometer well. maybe include my list of “things to try on the
capnometer”. talk about what the ideal breathing curve should look
like.]</p>
<h1 data-number="11" id="posture"><span
class="header-section-number">11</span> Posture</h1>
<p>I’m appreciating posture more now – it really makes silent relaxed
breathing easier when you have better posture. But “good posture” is
maybe not what society thinks is good posture, but whatever feels
comfortable to you and allows for good breathing.</p>
<p>The Buteyko people also emphasize posture, but I have not read much
about what they say.</p>
<p>i still have a lot to learn here. apparently some posture techniques
can be quite dangerous (can even cause die-off reactions??)</p>
<h1 data-number="12" id="breathing-synthesis"><span
class="header-section-number">12</span> Breathing synthesis</h1>
<p>My synthesis = “Buteyko method” + “Alexander Technique” + Capnometry
biofeedback</p>
<p>or maybe:</p>
<p>My synthesis = Nasal breathing + Silent relaxed breathing + Posture +
Habits + Capnometry biofeedback</p>
<ul>
<li>Buteyko provides nasal breathing, silent breathing and a theory of
air hunger via CO<sub>2</sub> levels. I put it in quotes because this is
probably a vast oversimplification of the Buteyko method – but I only
needed this much of the theory.</li>
<li>“Alexander Technique” is what I mean by just allowing the breath to
happen: smooth, not jerky. “Allowing the breath to happen” rather than
doing the breath. And also making the good breathing a <em>habit</em>
rather than “executing techniques” when you need them. Make it
automatic/autonomic/subconscious/unconscious, rather than
conscious/manual – this one might be two separate things actually (the
smooth part, and the unconscious/habit part). Some of the Buteyko people
also <em>mention</em> this, but it tends to be much more buried and not
<em>emphasized</em>. I think it really needs to be thought of as one of
the main components.</li>
<li>Capnometry biofeedback is discussed elsewhere in this document,
e.g., see the section <a
href="#the-unreasonable-effectiveness-of-capnometers">The unreasonable
effectiveness of capnometers</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h1 data-number="13" id="techniques-vs-habits"><span
class="header-section-number">13</span> Techniques vs habits</h1>
<p>One of the disagreements I’ve seen in the breathing world is the
emphasis between techniques vs habits. Those on the techniques side
(such as anxiety specialists and Buteyko practitioners) present various
techniques you can use when you are stressed, anxious, or have breathing
difficulty. Those on the habits side (such as Peter Litchfield) say that
techniques are mere bandage covering up a dysfunctional breathing habit,
and that the solution is to unlearn the old habits and introduce new
habits.</p>
<p>(actually i think <em>some</em> buteyko people have basically the
same views as me.)</p>
<p>I find myself somewhere in between these two views. In a sense, I
think both sides are right, and it’s actually quite important to
understand what’s going on here. Techniques are a way of
<em>learning</em> a thing. Once you’ve learned it, you don’t need to
“follow a technique” anymore, it’s just a part of you. But having it
verbally, explicitly, legibly, outlined is a useful step in actually
learning the thing initially. You follow the technique, you get anxious
about whether you’re doing it right, you get obsessed about it, you get
good at it, and then finally you get bored of it. It’s all part of the
<em>overlearning</em> process. Once your bodymind digests it, it poops
out the scaffolding of the technique and you can just Do The Thing. See
also the four stages of competence <span class="citation"
data-cites="fourstageswikipedia">(<span>“Four Stages of
Competence”</span> 2023)</span>.</p>
<p>So yes, do the techniques. Learn them so well that you get bored of
them and forget about them.</p>
<h1 data-number="14" id="breathing-techniques"><span
class="header-section-number">14</span> Breathing techniques</h1>
<p>Reminder that none of these techniques will work if you can’t breathe
through your nose comfortably. See the section <a

your nose.</p>
<h2 data-number="14.1" id="relaxed-silent-breathing"><span
class="header-section-number">14.1</span> Relaxed silent breathing</h2>
<p>This one is most similar to <span class="citation"
data-cites="rakhimov2013advanced">Rakhimov (2013, sec. 4.6, “Relaxing
the diaphragm (Buteyko relaxed breathing exercise)”)</span>, but Neil
Tranter also has a similar video <span class="citation"
data-cites="tranter2023relaxed">(Tranter 2023)</span>. <span
class="citation" data-cites="novozhilov2012">Novozhilov (2012)</span>
has similar exercises too (e.g., Exercise 1).</p>
<p>Exercise instructions: sit upright in a comfortable way. Breathe
silently through your nose. Then just try to make sure the exhale is
done in a completely relaxed way, where your whole body (but esp
diaphragm) relaxes. You are <em>not</em> pushing the air out. Just a
whole-body relaxation on every exhale. On each exhale scan <em>one</em>
body part for tenseness: shoulders? torso? legs? etc. Just focus on one
body part at a time, and try to relax it on the exhale, and keep it
relaxed. The idea of this exercise is that just by relaxing the exhale,
your breathing should slow down (but don’t try to artificially slow down
your breathing) and so it actually <em>is</em> a (mild) reduced
breathing exercise even though it just seems like a relaxation one. Do
this for 15 minutes or so.</p>
<p>Attention drifting during the exercise is a <em>good</em> thing
because you want to make sure this style of breathing becomes a
<em>habit</em> (rather than only occurring when you are consciously
executing the instructions). You want your mind to drift away from your
breath, as a way of giving yourself small opportunities to see if you
can maintain the same breathing pattern even when you are not paying
attention. The important point is that whenever you realize you have
drifted and you’re aware of your breathing again, you want to gently
check to make sure you’re still doing the completely relaxed exhale, and
that your body isn’t tense. You can even try to intentially pay
attention to something else, to distract yourself, so that you can check
back on your breath to see what it has been doing.</p>
<p>The whole exercise is basically juggling your attention in this way:
Is my inhale silent or as quiet as I can manage without tensing up? Is
my exhale completely relaxed? Are all of my body parts relaxed (except
spine, to keep an upright posture)?</p>
<p>If you have trouble relaxing your exhale or knowing whether you are
relaxing your exhale, try the <a href="#double-inhale-technique">Double
inhale technique</a> or try artificially slowing down just the first
part of your exhale. These two techniques should give you an easier time
relaxing the exhale so you will know what relaxation feels like.</p>
<p>Your hands may warm up a bit, and this seems like evidence that the
exercise is working.</p>
<p>note that i use the word “silent” rather than “quiet” because for a
long time i thought my breathing was quiet, but it turned out my
breathing was still making quite a bit of noise compared to what i
<em>could</em> do. i don’t want others to make the same mistake i did.
if your hearing is normal, you should not be able to hear your
breathing. if you are hard of hearing, then maybe get someone else to
check for you.</p>
<p>the goal is to eventually be breathing in this way all the time. so
it’s a “technique” but also it is going to become a habit.</p>
<p>an open question for me currently is: after you do this conscious
relaxed silent breathing, you will build up some mild air hunger. now,
<em>after</em> you complete the exercise, how long should you “keep”
that air hunger going? should you feel free to just take a slightly
deeper breath and “clear” the air hunger, or should you keep it going
for some time (if so, how long?), or should you just try to keep it
going as long as possible? i think trying to keep up the silent
breathing with slight air hunger for long enough periods tends to cause
a sudden burst of anxiety for me, like a sense of panic at not being
able to breathe. so i think that’s probably not the right thing to do.
but it’s confusing because i go from feeling totally comfortable with
the slight air hunger to suddenly feeling panicky. <span
class="citation" data-cites="mark2015deep">Lippmann (2015)</span> says
“This process [raising CO<sub>2</sub> tolerance over time] is long and
finicky and can cause very unpleasant symptoms. Less is more; barely
knowing whether you’re doing anything is best. You can also trigger
panic attacks or asthma attacks if you’re susceptible.” Another thought
is to, whenever possible when taking deeper breaths, to do so in more
Buteyko-aligned ways, e.g., through the nose and as gently as possible.
So don’t satisfy the urge for a deeper breath by inhaling with your
mouth or yawning or being super forceful about it, just try to gently
incline towards a deeper breath, a slight force with your nose. NOTE:
this may not be possible at first, e.g., i had to get to silent nasal
breathing in order to take “good” breaths with little force through my
nose. when i was still mouth breathing some of the time, i always had to
take a good breath through my mouth. then when i started nose breathing
(but loudly), i could take good breaths occasionally through my nose,
but only by loudly sniffing in. so there’s a gradual “handoff” where the
old normal becomes the new “rescue breath” method.</p>
<p>Try slouching too as you do this exercise, and in general experiment
with your posture. Your diaphragm will give you feedback on which
postures work best. For example, when I slouch as I do this exercise, I
notice my diaphragm can’t move as well (both for inhale and exhale).
Being too upright also makes it seem like my whole torso is too “stiff”.
So some intermediate posture seems to work best for me, but idk yet if
this is optimal.</p>
<p>I think this exercise might be “breathing-complete” in the sense that
it’s the only thing you need to cure shortness of breath – but I am
still actively testing out this hypothesis.</p>

<p><span class="citation" data-cites="tranter2022breathhold">Tranter

works, but somehow it’s just easier to exhale in a relaxed way from a

<li id="fn1"><p>By “breathing practice”, here I specifically mean
breathing practice to cure shortness of breath from over-breathing, but
it may also apply to meditative practices as well, I don’t know.<a

<li id="fn2"><p>From <span class="citation"
data-cites="capnolearningcourse">Litchfield and Reamer
(2024)</span>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You may be wondering, “can I benefit from the course without using
technology?” The answer, of course, is a resounding YES. The ultimate
objective of breathing behavior analysis work is NOT about learning to
use technology for manipulating breathing with physical techniques,
i.e., an outside-in paradigm, but rather it is about learning new
breathing habits that automatically optimize respiration, that is,
aligning breathing with respiration based on the principles of
self-regulation, an inside-out paradigm. The CapnoTrainer GO technology
is a powerful tool for making this transition from an outside-in to an
inside-out paradigm, that is, for identifying existing habits and
learning new ones.</p>
