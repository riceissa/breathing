<p>maybe a better title is: overcoming chronic shortness of breath by
fixing your breathing</p>
<h2 data-number="1.1"
id="what-kind-of-shortness-of-breathair-hunger-am-i-talking-about"><span
class="header-section-number">1.1</span> What kind of shortness of
breath/air hunger am I talking about?</h2>
<ul>
<li>feeling like you can’t get a good breath in</li>
<li>trying to take forceful breath by e.g. yawning</li>
<li>some breaths “feel good”, other ones (even forceful ones) “feel bad”
– there’s a binary classification</li>
<li>no obvious cause: not tied to exercise, seasons, allergen sources,
etc.</li>
</ul>
<h2 data-number="1.2" id="why-this-document"><span
class="header-section-number">1.2</span> Why this document?</h2>
<p>there has been a lot written about breathing, both in the academic
literature and in self-help/meditation/mindfulness contexts. why am i
adding my own words to this vast literature? what value am i adding?</p>
<p>I am writing basically the document I wish someone had handed to me
over a decade ago when I first started to experience shortness of
breath.</p>
<p>There’s a lot written about air hunger already. the problem is that
each source only seems to have a part of the solution. there’s no
one-stop place to get everything i need. so in some sense i’m just
synthesizing and collecting everything into one place.</p>
<p>but also, i’ve noticed a lot of sources making mistakes or not fully
explaining things. so i’ve had to think about some stuff and work it out
on my own or with friends, and also by experimenting on my own.</p>
<p>i will be critiquing a lot of sources as i discuss them. i don’t want
to sound too negative – it’s only because of all these sources that i’ve
made significant progress on overcoming my own breathing problem. but
seeing how things are explained incorrectly/what can go wrong is one of
the best ways to understand why something is the way it is. see <a
href="https://learning.subwiki.org/wiki/Importance_of_struggling_in_learning">here</a>
for more on this pedagogical perspective.</p>
<p>note to self: this document should have a tightly focused scope. it’s
to explain what is going on biologically in air hunger, and then explain
<em>how to get out of that state</em>. all my other random thoughts
about breathing should be put somewhere else. ask: will this directly
help someone who is suffering from shortness of breath?</p>
<p>a note for breathing experts: if you’re wondering what the philosophy
of this document is in a few words, check out the <a
href="#breathing-synthesis">Breathing synthesis</a> section. In short,
my philosophy is the “Buteyko method” + the “Alexander Technique” +
capnometry biofeedback, with the first two terms in quotes because I’m
sort of doing my own bastardized versions of them, and wouldn’t want to
claim I am propagating the “real thing”. If you don’t know what any of
the three terms mean, don’t worry! They will all be explained in the
course of this document.</p>
<p>i think a lot of resources are needlessly general, to the point where
the reader has to do a lot of work to figure out which parts to ignore
and which parts to follow. trying to satisfy everyone by writing super
generally means everyone gets a decent but not great experience. so i’m
solving this problem by writing for an extremely specific audience:
people like my past self. this will make the document useless or only
tangentially relevant to a lot of people, but for the intended audience,
it will be <em>exactly</em> what they need. i’ll try to make this
document a self-contained do-it-yourself guide on how to overcome
shortness of breath. many other guides don’t try to be self-contained;
they link out to other things that you can try, or otherwise make you
hunt down references or jump through hoops to get them. a printed
version of this document, without any internet connection, hopefully
with access to a capnometer, and about 2 months (half that if you can
already breathe through your nose) should suffice to fix air hunger.</p>
<p>my intention is also not to turn you into some sort of superhuman
breathing guru, or cure all your health problems, or whatever. there’s
only one goal, and it’s to completely eliminate air hunger. i think, if
you feel inspired by this document and want to go beyond by practicing
more advanced buteyko exercises using other sources, that’s a fine thing
to do! but this document is limited in scope. it only has the modest
goal of fixing the air hunger/shortness of breath and doing so in the
safest manner possible.</p>
<p>a lot of works are also very wordy and repetitive. this document
respects the intelligence of the reader. it emphasizes certain parts to
guide the reader, but it will not keep repeating the same things in
different words over and over. it will point out common
misunderstandings or common misinterpretations, but it will not spend
pages upon pages belaboring the point.</p>

<p>As for disclosures, I have nothing to disclose: I am not selling
anything. This document is freely available. I am not affiliated with
any of the products or services I recommend in this document. I don’t
use affiliate links.</p>
<p>also, while i’ve made significant progress on overcoming shortness of
breath, as of this writing i <em>still experience it daily</em>. so i
think there’s still insights i need to discover. but i think i am on the
right track in a way that i was <em>not</em> before mid-2023, so i think
at this point it makes sense to start writing things up and collecting
it all in one place, so that as i keep learning i can edit this
document. ultimate goal of this document: hopefully in a few months my
breathing will be fixed forever and this document will also completely
reflect my understanding of how i fixed it.</p>
<p>so yeah, i want to be honest that i haven’t figured it all out; i
won’t pretend i’ve figured it all out while leaving readers in the dark
feeling confused whether they’re missing something.</p>
<p>i probably said this somewhere else in the document already, but for
now this document is more of a research journal where i come to write
down my new ideas about breathing. i think it <em>can</em> be used as
instructions to replicate what i did to improve my breathing, but it’s
not mainly intended to be that, <em>at least for now</em>. In the
future, I want to turn this document more into a DIY guide to fix
breathing problems, but first i need to make sure my ideas are correct
and can <em>fully</em> resolve my own breathing problems.</p>
<h2 data-number="1.4"
id="ruling-out-more-serious-medical-problems"><span
class="header-section-number">1.4</span> Ruling out more serious medical
problems</h2>
<p>If you have the same kind of shortness of breath that I have, then
you <em>do</em> have a medical problem (this is defended at length in
the section <a href="#the-biological-basis-of-shortness-of-breath">The
biological basis of shortness of breath</a>), but first, it’s good to
rule out other more serious medical problems, or medical problems that
mainstream medicine knows how to treat.</p>
<p>I think as a first step, it’s a good idea to rule out any standard
problems with the lungs or other body organs, by e.g., doing a chest
x-ray, pulmonary function test, blood test, laryngoscopy to rule out
vocal cord dysfunction, etc. I will say more about what tests I got done
and why. The breathing stuff I describe later in the document
<em>might</em> help with your breathing anyway, even if you have a
problem with your lungs, but you definitely want to know if you do have
problems and to get proper treatment for those before progressing to any
breathing modification.</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/G3YHBYVxxmI?t=1049"
class="uri">https://youtu.be/G3YHBYVxxmI?t=1049</a> – Chris Gilbert
lists a bunch of possible reasons for hyperventilation that
<em>aren’t</em> just anxiety/stress.</p>
<p>basically, get yourself checked out by one or more doctors, go
through the standard protocol, and if the doctors tell you that there’s
nothing wrong or that your breathing problems are just due to anxiety,
<em>then</em> come back to this document and try using the methods in
it. the only exception i’m aware of so far is asthma. if you have
asthma, then supposedly buteyko breathing is also effective, so you can
get <em>both</em> mainstream medical treatment (e.g., inhalers) and try
the things in this document (though i don’t have any first- or
second-hand experience here so you should probably just go find a
buteyko book and follow that instead).</p>
<p>some other possible things that could be going on, where your
CO<sub>2</sub> <em>is</em> low but it’s not because of a dysfunctional
breathing habit: COPD (alveolar and arterial CO<sub>2</sub> mismatch),
metabolic acidosis (ketoacidosis, lactic acidosis) <span

Bradley, and Gilbert (2014, 6)</span></p>
<p>[TODO: add more details]</p>
<h1 data-number="2" id="safety"><span
class="header-section-number">2</span> Safety</h1>
<p>I want to make two seemingly contradictory remarks about the safety
of trying various breathing techniques.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Because I am <em>already</em> experiencing significant shortness
of breath, just by breathing the way I already am, I have a greater
appetite/tolerance for air hunger and unsafe breathing. Whether I like
it or not, I am already experiencing some significant amount of risk
just by existing in my current way.</p></li>
<li><p>I have the impression that a lot of breathing coaches and such
don’t emphasize safety enough. One of the reasons I didn’t get into
Buteyko breathing earlier (despite having known about it since early
2022 or so) is that I was put off by how dangerous it seemed.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>When I started practicing silent nasal breathing, I got a few weird
symptoms including head pressure, throat tightening (it felt as if I was
being subtly choked), and possibly others. (Since I have a mysterious
chronic illness, I have a daily occurrence of weird physical symptoms,
so I am already quite used to dealing with random new symptoms, and it’s
often hard to pin down <em>why</em> a new symptom started happening, but
in the case of head pressure and throat tightening, I am pretty
confident it happens because of the breathing.)</p>
<p>The other thing I want to say about safety. It’s not helpful when
people just tell you a blanket “if you have health issues, don’t attempt
this”. Part of <em>why</em> I’m interested in fixing my breathing is
because I already have breathing and other health issues. I shouldn’t
automatically be turned away from trying to solve these issues! So, I
don’t want to <em>ignore</em> safety issues, but I also don’t want to
give useless cowardly ass-covering safety warnings. How to avoid both
problems?</p>
<p>i also don’t want to just put a big safety warning at the start, and
then not mention safety at all later on. safety will be a concern
throughout. but, also, i will have a safety section here to give an
overview of what you might experience.</p>
<p>because i have a lot of health anxiety i am pretty nervous to try new
things. i think a lot of buteyko people don’t have this same
orientation. like, they are in it to get superpowers or something (like
sleeping only 2 hours a day) and not out of a sense of desperation to
breathe like a normal person. so in some sense this document is like a
maximally cautious, “only in it for the health improvements”
version.</p>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="novozhilov2012">Novozhilov
(2012)</span> mentions cleansing reactions that can happen, in the
section called “Cleansing reactions”. Unfortunately it just lists a
bunch of pretty nonspecific symptoms without any guidance on what to do
about them…</p>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="novozhilov2012">Novozhilov
(2012)</span>’s main suggestion for dealing with problems seems to be
“get an expert to coach you”. i mean, sure, that’s always one solution.
but what i’m trying to do here is to write everything down so that one
can do all the steps on one’s own, as safety and effectively as
possible.</p>
<p>buteyko people also mention this, but increased sensitivity to
medications can be a thing. i used to (2024-01-07 was last time i took
it before breathing changed) be able to take 5–10 drops of methyl
factors and it would just give me a bit of energy, but now (2024-01-27)
even 1 drop of it seems to send me into irritable/uncomfortable/anxious
state. i haven’t noticed this kind of heightened sensitivity with any of
my other meds/supplements so far though. because the methyl factors
thing has only happened once so far (i’m in the middle of the episode as
i write this), it <em>could</em> be a one-time fluke, who knows.</p>
<p>i tentatively recommend going pretty slowly (need a better descriptor
here…) so that you get adjusted to the changes. i’m not sure how to go
slowly on some of the steps (e.g., when i switched from loud nasal to
silent nasal, the loud nasal just felt very unnatural so i couldn’t go
back and titrate it).</p>
<p>if you are already ill in various ways like i am, then maybe it’s not
a big deal to suffer for a while and make rapid progress. the problem is
if it’s not <em>just</em> being uncomfortable for a while, but if it
becomes permanent or if it’s a sign of actually dangerous stuff
happening. i don’t know how to distinguish what each symptom means.
hence the recommendation to go slowly.</p>
<p>if done correctly, i think the buteyko relaxed breathing stuff is a
lot safer than relying on your own broken instincts about how hard you
should breathe. it’s only been 2 weeks now since my “breakthrough” on
january 15, but i’m noticing a lot less struggle with my breathing, like
even the couple of suffocation-like episodes seem milder than some of
the stuff i was already experiencing before.</p>
<p>notes from roam:</p>
<ul>
<li>one of the things i don’t like about buteyko ppl and also litchfield
is that they don’t emphasize safety enough… and like what do you
<em>do</em> if you start to get intracranial pressure or throat
tightening or other weird symptoms?</li>
<li>this is esp a problem in my case b/c i have other health conditions,
and buteyko ppl just do a blanket “if you have health problems, don’t do
buteyko”. that’s not helpful.</li>
<li>and this is esp a problem if like me, you start to just
automatically make better breathing a habit – then it’s hard to STOP
doing it. so what do you do then?</li>
</ul>
<p>update (2024-02-04): 3 weeks into mostly silent breathing, i am
having prolonged (what seems like) electrolyte issues. i can’t say for
sure that this is from the breathing, as i did eat a quite salty takeout
meal (and i’ve always been sensitive to salty foods), but this is the
first time it’s lasted 72 hours now (in the past similar things would
last at most a few hours).</p>
<p>2024-03-14: the throat choking and tense diaphragm thing has been
coming back, especially strongly when i talk for a long time (about an
hour). but often even when i haven’t been talking much. it’s the side of
the throat, not the center. i haven’t been very successful yet figuring
out what to do to fix this. i think for me the problem is the inhale,
since exhalation is just relaxing all the muscles to let air out.i’m
trying to “breathe in” to different parts of the body, like diaphragm,
back of throat, nostrils, etc. also trying to more artificially move
diaphragm instead of trying to breathe in with my throat muscles, and
then gradually toning down the amount of force i use with the diaphragm
while still keeping the throat inactive.</p>
<h2 data-number="2.1" id="accidental-meditation"><span
class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Accidental meditation</h2>
<p>as you try to normalize your breath, you’re constantly paying
attention to the way you breathe, and that’s essentially the mental
motion that meditators make (at least, when they do the kind of
meditation where they focus on their breath). could you be accidentally
meditating by trying to fix your air hunger? is that why the
intracranial pressure happens? how can we correct the breath without
risking accidentally meditating? (most people might have the sense that
meditation is harmless, but my current belief is that if you do more
than like a few minutes a day, then meditation requires a lot of care to
do correctly, and you can really risk hurting yourself/disrupting your
whole life. see stuff like “dark night of the soul”. as they say about
meditation, “Better not to start. Once started, better to finish.” you
really don’t want to accidentally meditate.)</p>
<p>i don’t have any good answers yet. i’m still working through this
myself. for the head pressure, it was somewhat bad for one day, but then
after that it just got better on its own, and now i don’t notice it at
all. i’ve also been just trying to do other stuff, so that even as i do
inevitably bring my attention back to my breath to see if i’m still
doing silent nasal breathing, i’m not just sitting there doing that the
entire day.</p>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="novozhilov2012">Novozhilov
(2012)</span> even says “Exercise 1 is really another version of
meditation using the focus on breathing and relaxation of the breathing
muscles as the means for avoiding wandering thoughts.”</p>
<p>as of 2024-02-17, i am less concerned about this. i basically don’t
notice any changes in my psychological state after focus on my breathing
so much. i think as long as you’re doing other stuff in the day, and not
just sitting there and thinking about breathing the whole day for hours
at a time, you should be fine.</p>
<h2 data-number="2.2" id="coughing"><span
class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Coughing</h2>
<p>Buteyko people seem too anti-coughing to me. My uninformed guess is
that it’s good to cough sometimes, e.g., to clear mucus or during a
viral infection. Then there are other more mysterious forms of cough
(e.g., twice in my life for like a month each, I had a habit of little
micro-coughs/chest itchy feeling) where I think suppressing the cough is
more justified (the second time it happened, doing soft breathing to
make the cough not trigger is what finally made it go away).</p>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="novozhilov2012">Novozhilov
(2012)</span> says to cough without opening your mouth, but based on
personal experience I think this is a bad idea. There can be too much
air coming through your nose which can damage the nose tissue. Anyway,
this was never a huge issue for me but people with actual asthma might
have to adopt different strategies.</p>
<h2 data-number="2.3" id="yawning"><span
class="header-section-number">2.3</span> Yawning</h2>
<p>I’ve seen quite often the advice to suppress yawns, but interestingly
even the buteyko people say (naturally-occurring) yawning is ok. <span

<h2 data-number="2.4" id="breath-holds"><span
class="header-section-number">2.4</span> Breath holds</h2>
<p>breath holds in general scare me, and i think it’s fine if you don’t
want to do them. really tiny ones (like 1–5 seconds) might be good, just
to get yourself used to the idea that not breathing for a few seconds
isn’t going to kill you (you can even have a pulse oximeter on your
finger as you do breath holds, to prove to yourself that your oxygen
saturation doesn’t drop or only drops an insignificant amount, like
1 percentage point); so i still do include <a

buteyko books like artour’s have more safety information about breath

class="header-section-number">2.5</span> Tension ping
pong/tennis/whackamole</h2>
<p>2024-06-05: i seem to be running into a problem where when i try to
do buteyko style breathing, or even just silent nasal breathing, i get
tension in my diaphragm and/or throat, and if i try really hard to make
the tension disappear from one of them (by relaxing that part), the
tension moves to the other part. in this way, the tension just keeps
bouncing back and forth, never really entering a state where i have no
tension. maybe i need to also start humming or something, not just doing
relaxed/reduced breathing.</p>
<p>with the throat tension, this may also have something to do with my
dysphagia.</p>
<h2 data-number="2.6" id="suffocation-feeling"><span
class="header-section-number">2.6</span> Suffocation feeling</h2>
<p>Scary experience on the night of 2024-06-07/morning of 2024-06-08: On
this night I was not able to do my new Buteyko routine around 9:30pm, as
things were hectic, so I thought I was being smart by trying to do
Buteyko (unguided by a recording) while trying to fall asleep in bed.
It’s supposed to regulate my breathing, and relax my body, so why not,
right? But as I did that I started to get the suffocation feeling (that
I sometimes get as I’m falling asleep; see <span class="citation"
data-cites="salamanderz12023">salamanderz1 (2023)</span> for a report of
what this feels like) and actually had to sit up and gasp for air. So at
that point I gave up on doing Buteyko and just went to sleep. I fell
asleep fine. But about 1.5 hours later, I woke up feeling short of
breath and noticed I was really straining multiple times to get a good
breath of air, and failing to get a good one. (Some of the straining was
mostly unconscious, not the conscious kind that I normally do while
awake, while others were consciously executed.) I checked on my pulse
oximeter and it was 98% (pulse was like 65bpm). It’s a very specific
kind of air hunger, different from turbinate swelling/mucus cloggage and
also different from the diaphragm tension stuff I’ve been having
recently.</p>
<p>As I was lying on my belly trying to figure out what to do, watery
mucus ran down my nose so I blew my nose, and I just naturally yawned a
few times, which made the air hunger better. I then tried going back to
sleep, but failed as the air hunger came back.</p>
<p>So at this point, I tried watching the experience more to see what
was going on. I noticed that the suffocation feeling happens on the
inhale (rather than on the exhale or during the pause after the exhale,
which is when a lot of other shortnesses of breath tend to happen). It
was as if somehow I was accidentally pre-empting the inhale rather than
letting the reflex do the work, and when that’s the case it somehow
feels bad. Sometimes even during the inhale I started to feel the panic
of suffocation. It felt like I had “forgotten how to breathe”, but in a
very specific way.</p>
<p>I also noticed that as I was lying in the dark, if I was tapping on
my arm during the inhale I could breathe fine. But if I stopped, my
brain would freak out when the inhale was about to happen. And even more
oddly, it felt like different lying positions would affect my breathing
differently: if I lay down in this weird diagonal way on my back (where
mostly the right side of my back is on the mattress, while the left side
is more in the air), my breathing seemed to normalize, whereas if I
tried curling up on my left side, it seemed to worsen. While curled up
on my left side, it felt like I need to tap to make the inhale happen.
(Which is actually very similar to how when I need to swallow, tapping
helps. See <span class="citation" data-cites="issarice2023swallow">Rice
(2023)</span>.) Could this be a CCI/AAI/spine problem?</p>
<p>I was able to breathe fine while typing out my symptoms on my phone,
but as soon as I tried to fall back asleep, my body freaked out like it
didn’t know how to breathe.</p>
<p>I felt very unconfident about my breathing, in a way I hadn’t felt
since maybe January or February 2024.</p>
<p>After about a total of an hour struggling in this way, I fell back
asleep. A few times during the night afterwards, I woke up briefly to
change my sleeping position, but my breathing was completely normal
then. In the morning when I woke up, it was also completely normal. But
as I sit up at my desk to type this up right now, I do feel a bit
breathless, maybe from being shaken up by the experience.</p>
<p>It’s not clear if (1) my breathing was already a bit dysregulated,
which made my Buteyko attempt fail, or (2) if I botched the Buteyko
practice by just trying to do it on my own, and that failure
dysregulated my instinctual breathing leading to worse breathing during
the night. I would guess probably (2) is most likely. So from now on, I
should only do Buteyko while I’m awake and guided by a recording. I’ve
been having success with the Sasha Yakovleva’s “You Just Landed On This
Planet” one and Neil Tranter videos (specifically <span class="citation"
data-cites="tranter2024deeprelaxation">Tranter (2024)</span>), and
hadn’t been experiencing any shortness of breath lately, so this was a
scary surprise, and I learned how fragile my improvements were and how
rigid my practice should be.</p>
<p>Another idea: my CP was critically low such that as I was inhaling I
was already suffocating.</p>
<h1 data-number="3"
id="the-biological-basis-of-shortness-of-breath"><span
class="header-section-number">3</span> The biological basis of shortness
of breath</h1>
<p>I <em>could</em> just tell you the exercises you need to do to fix
your breathing, but personally I find it unsatisfying when people tell
me to do a thing without also telling me why. So in this section, I will
give a simplified but (as far as I know) accurate biological explanation
of why you have shortness of breath. This will help you understand
<em>why</em> you should do the particular types of exercises I recommend
later on (in <a href="#breathing-exercises">Breathing
exercises</a>).</p>
<p>If you followed my advice and ruled out serious medical problems with
a doctor, you may be thinking there is no biological cause of your
shortness of breath, that it is more or less “in your head”. Certainly
this is what doctors kept telling <em>me</em>, that it was all due to
anxiety or some other hard-to-verify physical cause like mast cell
activation (primary care physician, two pulmonologists, allergist).</p>
<p>It turns out that there is a pretty well-understood cause of air
hunger! But to understand it, we need to have a decent understanding of
the chemistry of respiration; in particular we’ll need to correct some
misconceptions about breathing. So that’s what this section is
about.</p>
<p>The aim of this section is to give you a useful mechanistic model of
how respiration works. I will skip a lot of details because while it’s
helpful to know them, they aren’t essential.</p>
<p>The central thing we’re trying to explain here is: why is it that if
you have shortness of breath, the right thing to do is the breathe
<em>less</em>, even though your body is telling you to breathe
<em>more</em>? What is going on at the chemical level when people have
shortness of breath?</p>
<p>(If you prefer a video instead of text, <span class="citation"
data-cites="cooper2021">Cooper (2021)</span> is the best explanation I
have found. However there are a few things I don’t like about the
explanation in that video, so I’ve written my own version here. But if
you prefer a video explanation, then you can start with the video and
then come back here. If you do rely on the video, please at least skim
<span class="citation" data-cites="issarice2024analysis">Rice

videos.)</p>
<h2 data-number="3.1" id="how-breathing-works"><span
class="header-section-number">3.1</span> How breathing works</h2>
<p>(writing this section from memory; i think if i get anything wrong
here, it will be a good thing to point out in the final version!)</p>
<p>How does breathing happen? here is a very simplified sketch:</p>
<p><strong>The mechanical (inspiration and expiration):</strong> to
inhale, your muscles cause the lungs to expand in volume. As the volume
in the lungs increases, the air pressure inside the lungs starts to drop
(relative to the baseline of atmospheric pressure), causing air in the
atmosphere to enter your lungs, causing pressure to increase back toward
atmospheric pressure. To exhale, your muscles <em>relax</em> which
causes the lungs to contract (the lungs are elastic so they naturally
contract); this decrease in volume causes an increase in air pressure
(relative to the atmosphere) so some of the air in your lungs leaves. It
is also possible to do a forced exhale where the muscles actively
contract the lungs in order to push out even more air, but this does not
happen in a normal exhale.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p><strong>The chemical:</strong> at the very edges of your lungs are
tiny sacs called alveoli. the alveoli are surrounded by capillaries, and
this is where gas exchange takes place. when air from the atmosphere
arrives at the alveoli during inhalation, there is more oxygen in the
atmosphere air, so the oxygen diffuses into the capillaries. At the same
time, there is more carbon dioxide in the capillaries, so that diffuses
back into the alveoli and then out into the atmosphere. this two-way
diffusion is just happening all the time continuously, and inhalation
and exhalation just bring or pump out the air so that more diffusion can
take place. This two-way diffusion happening at the lungs is called
<strong>external respiration</strong>. The oxygenated blood then moves
through your body and goes out to all of your cells. At your cells, the
blood has oxygen and your cells have carbon dioxide, so another exchange
takes place, called <strong>internal respiration</strong>. Finally, all
the while your cells are using up the oxygen to produce more carbon
dioxide in a process called <strong>cellular respiration</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>The neural:</strong> What causes the urge to breathe? Humans
have what are called chemoreceptors in their brain (and some other
places) that tell the body to breathe. How do chemoreceptors know
<em>when</em> to send the signal to breathe? Do they just have a timer
in them and send a signal every few seconds? It turns out that they
watch out for signals from the body, in the form of carbon dioxide
levels, oxygen levels, and blood pH. Most of the time, when people
breathe, it is because the carbon dioxide level increased above some
threshold. Oxygen only triggers breathing when it gets really low (so
low that I don’t think most humans experience it except on very rare
occasions). I think blood pH also matters, but maybe only during
exercise? (but it might matter more for people with air hunger; see
below).</p>
<p>Notice how the three aspects interact: the mechanical action allows
the chemical exchange to take place (without just being stagnant at some
dynamic equilibrium). The chemical process is what stimulates the
nervous system. And the nervous system sends a signal to the mechanical
part to make the motions.</p>

Another thing to look at maybe: https://openstax.org/books/anatomy-and-physiology-2e/pages/22-3-the-process-of-breathing

also https://www.khanacademy.org/science/health-and-medicine/advanced-hematologic-system/x6e556f83:hemoglobin/v/bohr-effect-vs-haldane-effect -- i've never quite looked at the bohr and haldane effects but i probably should.

TODO: in the "neural" part: blood takes about 1 minute to circulate throughout the body. so it's not that the _same_ oxygenated blood went to the tissues, became deoxygenated, then came back, which is causing the urge to breathe. rather, it must be that the continual barrage of deoxygenated blood to the chemoreceptors is causing the urge to breathe.
does this mean that people with lower heart rate will have slower circulation so a slower breathing rate too?

you might have the impression that CO<sub>2</sub> is just a waste

problems for the body. [TODO: say more]</p>
<p>i’m not very attached to “high levels of CO2 are super healthy”. i

href="https://youtu.be/G3YHBYVxxmI?t=1527"
class="uri">https://youtu.be/G3YHBYVxxmI?t=1527</a>)</p>
<p>mention how people with shortness of breath might not think they are
hyperventilating. For example I don’t think I’ve ever overtly
hyperventilated in my life. And yet, I was constantly low-grade
overbreathing. <span class="citation"
data-cites="breathingdisordersbookchapter4">Gilbert (2014, 68)</span>
says “Hyperventilation tends to persist in many people, and once a
pattern of overbreathing is established it can be maintained by only a
10% increase in minute volume, which could be achieved by a combination
of deeper breaths, faster breathing, or an occasional sigh”. <span
class="citation" data-cites="breathingdisorders1stedchapter10">Chaitow,
Bradley, and Gilbert (2002, 246)</span> is also great and I wish someone
had pointed me to it because I kept thinking “there’s no way I’m
hyperventilating, I sure am not acting like how it is portrayed in
media”; I have no idea why they removed it in the second edition of the
book. However, I think their list of criteria for detecting
overbreathing are not great. In particular, if you’re nose breathing but
your breathing is clearly audible, then I think that’s a sign of
overbreathing.</p>
<p>kidneys are supposed to adjust within 5 days. BUT mine seem to be
taking a lot longer (it’s been about 2 weeks of normal baseline
CO<sub>2</sub> according to capnometer now as of 2024-01-31, and i’m
still having air hunger daily). why could this be?</p>
<ul>
<li>it’s possible that with my dysautonomia (and/or whatever else is
wrong with me) my kidneys are just not NORMAL kidneys, but sluggish
broken kidneys</li>
<li>i also have an inkling that the studies they did on this was for ppl
who overbreathed during the experiment, not ppl who have been
overbreathing for literally over 10 years. it’s possible (just like with
SSRIs or various other medications or w/e) that if you’ve been
overbreathing for much longer, then your kidneys are just “more stuck”,
“more set in their ways”, than the standard experimentally verified
number. if true, now that i am at a normal CO<sub>2</sub> baseline, i
should just be able to literally keep going, keep doing the same thing,
and the air hunger should just gradually disappear.</li>
<li>maybe my bicarbonate levels take 3–5 days to adjust to one
additional “rung”, and there are like several rungs? i am not quite sure
how that would be, but this could be why it’s taking way longer than 5
days. (and experiments maybe only tested a “one-rung change”.) It would
make sense that making a greater change takes a longer time.</li>
<li>the literature could just straight up be <em>wrong</em> about this,
like, on what experimental or theoretical basis are they even claiming
the kidneys take 5 days? i have not looked into the actual experiments
so i can’t tell whether people are just parroting flawed studies or the
experiments were replicated.</li>
<li>the other idea is that my CO<sub>2</sub> is totally normal now when
I measure during the day, but somehow, somewhere, I’m still
overbreathing. Maybe in my sleep, maybe in small pockets of time when
I’m stressed, maybe whenever I talk. And that little bit of
overbreathing is preventing the bicarbonate levels from fully adjusting.
Hence why I still feel subtle air hunger.</li>
<li>Vipul notes that the literature may be basing kidney adjustments
partly on mountain climbers (“altitude acclimatization”) who are
adjusting to low CO<sub>2</sub> so are shedding more bicarbonate rather
than in the case of overbreathers who are trying to gain back their
bicarbonate. Mountain climbers are also adjusting to lower
O<sub>2</sub>, not just CO<sub>2</sub>. So it’s possible that what
happens to them is just quite different from what happens to chronic
overbreathers.</li>
</ul>
<p>I don’t know why no one seems to ever talk about this, but there are
literal blood and urine tests to measure bicarbonate levels (it’s called
“total carbon dioxide”, and is included in the comprehensive metabolic
panel, which is a pretty common test. Total CO<sub>2</sub> includes not
just bicarbonate but also the dissolved CO<sub>2</sub> in blood and the
CO<sub>2</sub> carried by hemoglobin or something, but the bicarbonate
makes up most of the total carbon dioxide. However, I am still confused
about how to interpret the results of this test). In the US at least, if
you have a good insurance or Medicaid or something, then (assuming you
can convince a doctor to order the test) this seems like a <em>way</em>
cheaper way to see if you have hypocapnia, although it won’t really
allow you to do real-time biofeedback like with a capnometer.
(Update(2024-02-07): this turned out to be WRONG. My total
CO<sub>2</sub> has been normal this whole time despite my end-tidal
CO<sub>2</sub> being low. So getting a normal level on the total
CO<sub>2</sub> test does not actually rule out hypocapnia.) I think
these blood/urine tests might also be very helpful in intermediate
stages of recovery (like where I am at now as of 2024-02-02) where my
CO<sub>2</sub> levels are normal according to the capnometer but I still
have that subtle feeling of air hunger. (Update(2024-02-07): I am no
longer so sure about this… I think the total carbon dioxide test might
be useless.)</p>
<p>I have not tried this, but it is possible to <em>supplement</em>
bicarbonate in addition to changing breathing habits, which might speed
up progress: “Long-distance runners, sprinters and horse trainers have
experimented successfully with doses of sodium bicarbonate, which
supplements the natural bicarbonate buffer and opposes the lactic acid
load created by exercising muscles” <span class="citation"
data-cites="breathingdisordersbookchapter4">(Gilbert 2014, 66)</span> <a
href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC435634/pdf/jcinvest00601-0100.pdf"
class="uri">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC435634/pdf/jcinvest00601-0100.pdf</a>
(“STUDIES ON HYPERVENTILATION. II. ELECTROCARDIOGRAPHIC CHANGES IN
NORMAL MAN DURING VOLUNTARY HYPERVENTILATION” by B. CHR. CHRISTENSEN)
also mentions an experiment to give large doses of sodium bicarbonate to
subjects to generate (?!) a feeling of air hunger. more bicarbonate
mimics the effects of less CO<sub>2</sub>. so maybe supplementing
bicarbonate isn’t the solution.</p>

<p>2024-05-07: so something interesting has happened: on sunday
(2024-05-05), all day long, my parents and i did a lot of cleaning and
moving furniture around the house, which created a <em>lot</em> of dust,
and because i didn’t seem to be reacting at the time (e.g. I wasn’t
sneezing, or maybe I only sneezed once) I didn’t think to wear a mask.
but yesterday i had some more classic allergy symptoms, like sneezing,
breathing difficulty, and itchy-feeling insides. and today i am having
breathing difficulty again. but what’s interesting is that this
breathing difficulty feels <em>exactly</em> like the breathing
difficulty i had in 2023, before the capnotrainer stuff. and
specifically, i’m noticing that using the nasal strip is helping a lot
but the saline spray did nothing. but i don’t think i was mysteriously
exposed to a lot of allergens in 2023 that somehow went away in 2024. so
instead i am thinking that allergies have caused my turbinates to become
swollen, and the completely via a different mechanism, overbreathing
also causes my turbinates to become swollen. which is why the nasal
strips worked so well even in 2023. so, what’s the point of all of this?
i think one takeaway i have is that it’s <em>not</em> just the
Henderson-Hasselbalch stuff and increased CO<sub>2</sub> sensitivity in
overbreathers that causes the shortness of breath feeling, but also,
there’s a pathway like overbreathing → body tries to prevent you from
breathing so much <span class="math inline">\(\to\)</span> inflates
turbinates to compensate <span class="math inline">\(\to\)</span> now
your nostrils are super tight <span class="math inline">\(\to\)</span>
feel like you can’t breathe.</p>
<p>maybe the turbinates get puffed up during allergies to prevent more
allergens from coming in?</p>
<p>also it’s interesting that the breathing difficulty came on only 1–2
days <em>after</em> probably most of the dust exposure. this actually
also happened in 2023, i had a breathing attack in the early morning of
2023-02-15 while i was asleep, and had to go to urgent care later that
day. but the actual exposure (and at the time i didn’t know it was from
this, although it was one of the ideas i had) was on 2023-02-13 when in
the evening i cleaned my window blinds (which hadn’t been cleaned in a
very long time and had a lot of dust). i remember mentioning the blinds
dusting to one of my pulmonologists, who dismissed the idea given that
it was two days after the exposure. but now that it’s happened
<em>again</em>, after my breathing has substantially improved (and with
no other reason for my breathing to suddenly get much worse, e.g. i
wasn’t talking a lot), i am sure it’s from the dust/allergic reaction
(although i’m less certain about whether it’s some sort of systemic
reaction, or if it’s mediated by the turbinates inflating).</p>
<p>i wonder if in cases like this where allergies are clearly involved
whether azelastine will actually have any benefit. however, i seem to
not respond to any of the oral anti-histamines that i have tried
(claritin, xyzal, zyrtec) even when I am in this state.</p>
<p>as of 2024-05-08 my breathing is basically back to my
post-capnotrainer usual baseline. i haven’t needed to use a nasal strip
today.</p>

((TODO:
Vipul says "Regarding the Henderson-Hasselbach, I think you can maybe give a TL;DR version where you say that chemical equilibrium works multiplicatively (in proportional terms) on concentrations, which is why the sensitivity to additional CO2 is proportional to the level of CO2.
I mean, it's not a full explanation, but for those who vaguely remember equilibrium from high school or college chemistry, that should be enough to make it click
(You should also include the fuller explanation, but at least people have a tagline to fall back to)
and use the word _proportional_
Rather than just 'when it's lower it's more sensitive'
though I think ultimately it may not be strictly proportional, at least that is the first-pass intuition we're drawing on
(and plugging in the Henderson-Hasselbach also yields proportionality)"

<p>[argh, this is kind of hard to explain well. curse of knowledge…]</p>
<p>Okay, so CO<sub>2</sub> levels (partial pressure?) in the blood
regulate breathing. Now let’s imagine what happens when someone
overbreathes. You might think, okay, CO<sub>2</sub> goes down, so then
you don’t get as much of an urge to breathe. That’s true in the short
term. But if someone <em>chronically</em> overbreathes, then the bodies
tries to correct this. You see, the body tries very hard to keep the
blood pH at a narrow range of 7.35–7.45. If one chronically
overbreathes, then since CO<sub>2</sub> causes the blood to become
acidic, the <em>lack</em> of CO<sub>2</sub> (you’re overbreathing,
remember) causes your blood to become too alkaline. So the body
compensates by trying to make blood more acidic. How? The kidneys dump
out more bicarbonate (<span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{HCO_3^-}\)</span>) into the urine. Since
bicarbonate is alkaline, getting rid of it makes the blood more acidic.
The kidneys don’t react immediately; all this happens over the course of
hours to roughly 5 days.</p>

<p>The important point is that because of the form of the
Henderson–Hasselbalch equation, the more CO<sub>2</sub> you have, the
less sensitive pH is to slight increases in CO<sub>2</sub>. So breath
holding for a few seconds does not cause air hunger/panic/suffocation.
Whereas if your CO<sub>2</sub> is already too low (hypocapnia), then
your pH is still normal (thanks to the bicarbonate levels being adjusted
by your kidneys), but because of the low CO<sub>2</sub>, even slight
changes in CO<sub>2</sub> can cause large shifts in pH. I think it’s
this decrease in pH (when CO<sub>2</sub> rises, blood becomes more
acidic so pH goes down) that triggers a strong sense of air hunger. If
you give in to this urge and breathe, then your pH will be restored, so
<em>temporarily</em> you will feel better. But if you keep giving into
this urge and breathing more and more, then over time you’re shifting
down your bicarbonate buffer even more. Your body adjusts. But that
means your baseline CO<sub>2</sub> also keeps decreasing. So now you’re
<em>even more</em> sensitive to slight increases in CO<sub>2</sub>. It’s
a vicious cycle. (and this isn’t even talking about the negative health
effects of low CO<sub>2</sub>.)</p>
<p>Let’s look at some numbers.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[7.4 \approx 6.1 +
\log_{10}\left(\frac{24}{0.0307 \cdot 40}\right)\]</span></p>
<p>above are the values for a normal person.</p>
<p>When I first used a capnometer, my CO<sub>2</sub> was around 25 mmHg.
So to get the same pH, my bicarbonate level must have been around 15
(here I’m just solving for <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> in the
equation <span class="math inline">\(24/40 = x/25\)</span> in order to
make the input to <span class="math inline">\(\log_{10}\)</span> the
same):</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[7.4 \approx 6.1 +
\log_{10}\left(\frac{15}{0.0307 \cdot 25}\right)\]</span></p>
<p>Now let’s say both individuals do a breath hold to raise their
PCO<sub>2</sub> by 5 mmHg. In the case of the healthy person, their pH
goes down to 7.34, but in the chronic overbreather’s case, it goes down
to 7.31.</p>
<p>here’s the other thing vipul showed me:</p>
<p>suppose your equation right now is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
  \mathrm{pH} &amp;\approx 6.1 +
\log_{10}\left(\frac{\mathrm{[HCO_3^-]}}{0.0307 \cdot
p\mathrm{CO_2}}\right) \\
              &amp;= 6.1 + \log_{10}(\mathrm{[HCO_3^-]}) -
\log_{10}(0.0307) - \log_{10}(p\mathrm{CO_2})
\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>Now you hold your breath so that the <em>p</em>CO<sub>2</sub> goes up
by some amount, <span class="math inline">\(\Delta
p\mathrm{CO_2}\)</span>, and the pH changes by some amount, <span
class="math inline">\(\Delta \mathrm{pH}\)</span> (it’s a negative
quantity, since your pH goes down when the blood becomes more acidic).
Your equation now looks like:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
  \mathrm{pH} + \Delta \mathrm{pH} &amp;\approx 6.1 +
\log_{10}\left(\frac{\mathrm{[HCO_3^-]}}{0.0307 \cdot (p\mathrm{CO_2} +
\Delta p\mathrm{CO_2})}\right) \\
                                   &amp;= 6.1 +
\log_{10}(\mathrm{[HCO_3^-]}) - \log_{10}(0.0307) -
\log_{10}(p\mathrm{CO_2} + \Delta p\mathrm{CO_2})
\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>Now let’s subtract the first equation from the second; we get:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
  \Delta \mathrm{pH} &amp;= \log_{10}(p\mathrm{CO_2}) -
\log_{10}(p\mathrm{CO_2} + \Delta p\mathrm{CO_2}) \\
                     &amp;=
\log_{10}\left(\frac{p\mathrm{CO_2}}{p\mathrm{CO_2} + \Delta
p\mathrm{CO_2}}\right) \\
                     &amp;= - \log_{10}\left(1 + \frac{\Delta
p\mathrm{CO_2}}{p\mathrm{CO_2}}\right)
\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>What does all of this show? Well, the quantity <span
class="math inline">\(\frac{\Delta
p\mathrm{CO_2}}{p\mathrm{CO_2}}\)</span> is actually the fractional
change in pCO<sub>2</sub>. So it shows that <em>the change in pH is a
function of the fractional change in pCO<sub>2</sub></em>. This is one
way to understand why having low CO<sub>2</sub> means your pH changes
more easily: the same amount of absolute CO<sub>2</sub> change results
in a greater fractional change in CO<sub>2</sub>. (Note: fractional
change is almost the same thing as percentage change, just divided by
100.)</p>

<p>This seems wrong to me, but I should look at the cited works by Ley:
“Ley (1988a, 1988b) has offered a plausible explanation for this
phenomenon based on the body’s adaptation to chronic hyperventilation.
The long-term reduction in bicarbonate buffer concentration, offsetting
lowered PaCO2, returns pH to normal, but the equilibrium is an uneasy
one, dependent on the hyperventilation continu- ing. This situation
makes the individual more susceptible than ever to a rise in CO2 (more
acidity) because the alka- line buffer has been reduced. Consequently a
change in breathing toward normal, away from hyperventilation, would
feel closer to suffocation than if the person pos- sessed normal
bicarbonate buffering capacity.” <span class="citation"
data-cites="breathingdisordersbookchapter4">(Gilbert 2014, 68–69)</span>
Specifically, i don’t think it’s the lower bicarbonate that is the
problem, it’s the lowered CO<sub>2</sub>. i think the literature is very
misleading about this point and they all keep repeating the same
mistaken thing, and none of them actually provide a mathematical model
of this. In more detail: The specific sentence I am critiquing is: “This
situation makes the individual more susceptible than ever to a rise in
CO2 (more acidity) because the alkaline buffer has been reduced.” In the
HH equation, the bicarb concentration is a constant because the rise in
CO2 being mentioned here is an acute one. The things that are changing
are the CO2 and pH, and the reason the pH changes more is because the
CO2 is already low. The reason the CO2 is low is because the person
chronically overbreathed. The reason the CO2 <em>remains</em> low is
because the bicarbonate level also changed. But you see how that’s like,
several levels of indirection until we even get to the bicarb. Saying
the word “because” followed by the bicarb/alkaline buffer makes it seem
like that’s the direct/primary reason, but in reality it’s instead just
this thing in the background that is keeping up the equilibrium.
However, I do admit the author here may have had the correct model and
was just wording it poorly.</p>
<p>“Thus the chronic hyperventilator’s pH regulation is finely balanced:
diminished acid (the consequence of hyperventilation) is balanced
against the low level ofblood bicarbonate maintained by renal excretion.
In this equilibrium small amounts of over- breathing induced by emotion
can cause large falls of carbon dioxide (PC2o) and, consequently, more
severe symptoms. In other words, the chronic hyper- ventilator lives
closer to the threshold for hypocapnia than the normal person.” <a

– another example of a paper seemingly getting this wrong.</p>
<p>for advanced buteyko practitioners however, my current guess is that
their PCO<sub>2</sub> levels are normal (40–45 mmHg). so now, how do we
explain how they can hold their breaths for so long? i think some other
factors are at play here including:</p>
<ul>
<li>less sensitive chemoreceptors</li>
<li>hemoglobin count or efficiency</li>
<li>myoglobin count or efficiency</li>
<li>reduced or more efficient cellular metabolism (slower rate of
generation of CO2)</li>
<li>higher lung capacity</li>
</ul>
<p>some of the above may also be happening in going from chronic
overbreather to normal breather, but it’s not obviously necessary to
explain the differences in CO<sub>2</sub> tolerance between overbreather
and normal.</p>
<h2 data-number="3.5" id="upshot"><span
class="header-section-number">3.5</span> Upshot</h2>
<p>So what we’ve established is:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you have shortness of breath with no clear medical cause, it is
likely that your CO<sub>2</sub> level (and thus bicarbonate level) is
too low.</li>
<li>Low CO<sub>2</sub> means you are more sensitive to changes in
CO<sub>2</sub>, in particular to increases in it. This is why you always
feel short of breath.</li>
<li>The solution is <em>not</em> to “take a deep breath” and get more
oxygen (you already have plenty of oxygen, probably too much, as can be
verified easily with a pulse oximeter), but rather, to breathe
<em>less</em> so that you <em>gradually</em> raise your CO<sub>2</sub>
levels. The emphasis is on the word “gradually”. If you just hold your
breath as long as possible in the hopes of raising your CO<sub>2</sub>,
you will just give yourself a panic attack. The kidneys take time to
adjust the bicarbonate levels. So you want to sit with a
slight-to-moderate amount of air hunger, over the course of days and
weeks, so as to gradually raise your baseline CO<sub>2</sub>. How to do
this? We’ll discuss breathing techniques and breathing habits more
elsewhere in this document (see the sections <a
href="#techniques-vs-habits">Techniques vs habits</a> and <a
href="#breathing-exercises">Breathing exercises</a>).</li>
</ul>
<h1 data-number="4"
id="what-does-normal-breathing-feel-like-is-healthy-breathing-the-same-for-everyoneis-normal-breathing-universal"><span
class="header-section-number">4</span> What does normal breathing feel
like? Is healthy breathing the same for everyone?/Is normal breathing
universal?</h1>
<p>One of the weird things I discovered while using the CapnoTrainer is
that the breathing style that brought CO<sub>2</sub> levels up to normal
in the most effortless way turned out to be what the Buteyko people have
been saying all along: silent nasal breathing. This raises the question
of whether there is some universally “optimal” breathing style that
everyone should have, or if it’s more of a preference (different people
can have different breathing styles, but what matters is that your
CO<sub>2</sub> levels are normal and you don’t have air hunger or other
breathing issues).</p>
<p>Peter Litchfield on the other hand says that it doesn’t matter how
you breathe – you could even mouth breathe – as long as your breathing
habits are “functional” (by which I think he means your CO<sub>2</sub>
levels are at like 40 mmHg). For example see <span class="citation"
data-cites="capnolearningbook">Litchfield and Reamer (2023, 21)</span>,
where “There is an ideal breathing pattern that each of us needs to
learn” is listed as a misconception.</p>
<p>unfortunately it’s hard to get descriptions of what normal breathing
feels like from normal people because those are the people for whom
nothing about their breathing has ever been wrong. so they don’t think
about their breathing. they don’t know how to contrast normal breathing
to what abnormal or overbreathing feel like. here i will try my best to
share glimpses of what normal breathing feel like, although caveat as
usual that i have not fully fixed my breathing problem yet.</p>
<p>in normal breathing:</p>
<ul>
<li>there is no urge to take a deep breath if one is just quietly
sitting. this is indefinite, in contrast to air hunger where one might
be able to take a few quiet breaths in a row but then the urge to take a
deep one builds up over time. in normal breathing, there is no
buildup.</li>
<li>silent nasal breathing is sufficient (at least when seated or lying
down)</li>
<li>it is still possible to take a deep breath. these feel better than
normal breaths, but there is no compulsion to keep achieving that deep
breath. it’s currently not clear to me why normal people don’t develop
an addiction to taking deep breaths…</li>
</ul>
<h1 data-number="5"
id="can-you-overshoot-your-co2-levels-by-doing-too-much-reduced-breathing"><span
class="header-section-number">5</span> Can you overshoot your
CO<sub>2</sub> levels by doing too much reduced breathing?</h1>
<p>so you combat air hunger by breathing less, which raises
CO<sub>2</sub>. what if you just keep going? could you be overshooting
and getting <em>hypercapnia</em> instead?</p>
<p>Here’s a heuristic argument for why this shouldn’t happen: even
people who overbreathe don’t overbreathe so much that their
CO<sub>2</sub> just keeps dropping indefinitely. Each style of breathing
seems to asymptote at a certain point. So I think Buteyko-style reduced
breathing also asymptotes in terms of CO<sub>2</sub> levels.</p>
<p>But also, I think there must be some other effect going on, because I
don’t think the Buteyko people have abnormally high CO<sub>2</sub>
(that’s just my current guess). the only source i’ve found so far is the
graphs in <span class="citation" data-cites="altukhovcharts">Altukhov
(2009)</span> where the highest tier (tier V) under “Super Endurance”
has an alveolar CO<sub>2</sub> of 54 mmHg. But they also list “normal”
as being 46 mmHg which seems too high…</p>
<p>the main lesson here is that having a capnometer is quite useful, to
give the assurance that your CO<sub>2</sub> levels are normal.</p>
<p>another reason to not worry: if you are doing buteyko
<em>correctly</em>, then any reduction in breathing must come from
relaxation. you should only just barely have any air hunger. if you are
overshooting and making yourself actually uncomfortable, then you will
start to feel a lot of air hunger and tense up, and that will be a
signal to ease off. so basically your body has a corrective mechanism
built in.</p>
<h1 data-number="6" id="a-short-timeline-of-my-improvements"><span
class="header-section-number">6</span> A short timeline of my
improvements</h1>
<p>i don’t know how representative the speed of my improvements is, but
it’s the only case i am deeply familiar with, and it might give people
an idea of what to expect.</p>
<ul>
<li>sometime in 2010–2015: i go to my primary care doctor several times
complaining about shortness of breath. each time he gives me an
albuterol inhaler and i try it and it does nothing. then the problem
just randomly goes away and i give up trying to figure out what’s going
on.</li>
<li>2019: the breathing problem is more persistent starting around this
year, which is also the year when most of my other symptoms started
showing up.</li>
<li>in early 2022, ML gives me a brief overview of CO<sub>2</sub> theory
but i don’t understand it at all (to be fair, it was an impromptu
explanation and also i was probably brain fogged). but he gives the
upshot that the concrete thing i should do is to briskly walk for 40
minutes per day for one week straight, and this should normalize my
CO<sub>2</sub> tolerance. i try it, and it does nothing. he also
mentions buteyko breathing to me, in probably in mid-2022, saying i can
maybe look into it. i don’t (not because i didn’t want to, but because i
have so many other symptoms to research and deal with and quite limited
energy due to illness and because i read a little bit about it and it
seemed way too difficult to understand).</li>
<li>2022–2023: a lot of going to doctors to try to figure out what’s
wrong with my breathing. multiple chest x-rays, methacholine challenge,
pulmonary function exam, exhaled nitric oxide test, a bunch of doctors
(including pulmonologists) listening to my breathing with a
stethoscope.</li>
<li>July 2023: emergency room visit due to severe difficulty breathing.
this happened after like a 2–3 hour doctor appointment where i had to
talk a lot. i had to cut the meeting short because i was unable to talk
by the end. going to the ER really motivates me to solve the breathing
problem, because i don’t want this to happen ever again. i start doing a
lot of digging on the internet about air hunger etc.</li>
<li>July/August 2023: i learn a basic version of the CO<sub>2</sub>
theory via howard cooper videos. i realize this is probably the thing ML
was trying to tell me about in early 2022. i start playing around with
breath holds and other gentle buteyko exercises using neil tranter
videos. in end of august i also started reading <span class="citation"
data-cites="nestor2020">Nestor (2020)</span> and trying to switch to
nasal-only breathing, and basically succeed over the course of a month
or so. i also probably tried nasal strips for the first time this
month.</li>
<li>(not much new happens in this period in terms of my understanding,
but once i make the adjustment to nasal breathing around
august–september, my breathing problem is generally like 60–80% better,
except when i speak, at which point it goes back to being moderately
bad.)</li>
<li>January 2024: capnotrainer. i finally figure out how to silently
breathe. my baseline end-tidal CO<sub>2</sub> goes from like 27–30 mmHg
to 37–40 mmHg. there’s just a subtle air hunger left now, except when i
talk; when it talk it can still get pretty bad, but i’m better at
recovering by doing silent relaxed nasal breathing.
<ul>
<li>9th: first day of capnotrainer.</li>
<li>15th: breakthrough.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>February 2024: simon spire course; no progress.</li>
<li>March 2024: starting to do a more serious buteyko practice, as i
think my main problem right now might just be that i’m not logging
enough time doing deliberate breathing exercises.</li>
</ul>
<h1 data-number="7"
id="sequence-of-cumulative-constraints-of-breathing-practice"><span
class="header-section-number">7</span> Sequence of cumulative
constraints of breathing practice</h1>
<p>We are now transitioning to the more practical sections of this
document. But before we get to the actual exercises, I want to say a few
things about the mindset/global structure of the practice.</p>
<p>I think it may be helpful to conceptualize breathing practice<a
href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> not as a set of “breathing
techniques” that you practice over time to help calm you down or
whatever (such as: “when you’re feeling anxious, do square breathing;
once you feel comfortable with that, you can move onto different
patterns like 4-7-8”), but instead as a <em>sequence of cumulative
constraints</em>. The reason for having a <em>sequence</em> is that it’s
too hard to pay attention to the more subtle stuff and get it right all
on the first try before you get the basics down; each stage might take a
month or more. (The other reason for this particular sequence: if you
follow the sequence, then by doing the previous steps, you automatically
almost do the next stage, so that at each stage you only need to put in
a <em>little</em> bit of effort, not invent a whole new thing.) The
reason for having <em>constraints</em> rather than practices is that it
mostly doesn’t matter <em>how</em> you achieve good breathing, you just
want the outcome.</p>
<p>This page used to use the phrase “sequence of moving targets” rather
than “sequence of cumulative constraints”, but I renamed this page
because I thought the new version is a more accurate phrasing. Like the
Gram–Schmidt process in linear algebra the constraints are cumulative
(at each step <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, you want to make
sure that the new vector you create is orthogonal not just to the <span
class="math inline">\((n-1)\)</span>th vector, but to <em>all</em> the
vectors <span class="math inline">\(1, \dots, n-1\)</span>. This kind of
mechanic also happens a lot in puzzle games where if you get one thing
in a “good” state, and then try to get another thing in a “good” state,
the first one will turn back into a “bad” state, and the difficulty of
the puzzle is to make sure you can get all the good states
cumulatively). Also “constraint” feels more accurate than “target”
because you’re not trying to hit some new breathing pattern some of the
time, but rather you’re trying to <em>only</em> do the “good” kind of
breathing <em>all</em> of the time.</p>
<h2 data-number="7.1" id="the-sequence"><span
class="header-section-number">7.1</span> The sequence</h2>
<p>Here is the sequence I am thinking of:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Initially, because I was still mouth-breathing a significant
percentage of the time (20%?), my constraint was to do nasal breathing.
<em>Any</em> nasal breathing. The goal was simply to get away from the
habit of mouth breathing. Nasal breathing is a good first target because
(a) it’s extremely obvious whether any particular breath happens through
the nose or mouth; and (b) on its own it already has pretty dramatic
effects (see <span class="citation" data-cites="nestor2020">Nestor
(2020)</span> for a lot more detail on this). Achieving nose breathing
itself occurs in two stages:
<ul>
<li>Consciously do nasal breathing. You use any and all tools you have
to try to nose breathe: just anxiously paying attention all the time,
nasal strips, nose cones, azelastine, NeilMed, allergy sheets, etc.
(Flonase is another option that <em>might</em> help people but it didn’t
work for me because of side-effects and there’s a chance it builds up a
dependence even though it’s not supposed to?) You want to get to a point
where the only times you mouth breathe are when you have to blow your
nose, when you swim, when you take a shower, or things like that. I nose
breathe even with a mask on, even when I’m brushing my teeth, and as
much as possible even in my sleep (mouth taping might help with this).
(This step took around 1 month for me.)</li>
<li>Eventually, it becomes automatic, and you won’t even need the
training wheels. (After a month, my nasal breathing became
habitual/automatic. I remained at this stage for the next 4 months or
so, not because I wanted to but because I wasn’t sure what to do
next.)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Next stage: silence your breath.
<ul>
<li>Same two stages here (conscious/manual techniques, then
unconscious/automatic habit). Silent breath is the next constraint
because it’s also easy to detect: it means you can’t hear your own
breath at all (neither inhale nor exhale). Silent breath. At least when
you’re just sitting or standing. I’m not sure how feasible it is yet to
have a silent breath while exercising. (This stage took about a week
once I got the CapnoTrainer, though arguably it’s still ongoing. In
particular, there was a 24 hour period where I had a kind of epiphany
and figured out how to do this right.)</li>
<li>As with the nose breathing stage, you don’t have to get it to be
perfect. Sometimes, breathing in a silent way can make your diaphragm or
your throat hurt. I think this happens because you’re manually trying to
control those muscles too hard by tensing them up in the wrong ways. If
that’s the case, you can try for a while to just make a bit of noise
when breathing, just like you might still have “rescue breaths” through
your mouth sometimes.</li>
<li>Eventually, given a choice between silent vs natural, you want to
pick natural, but still silent is the initial target because it’s so
much easier to tell when something is silent vs natural.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Next stage: smooth your breath.
<ul>
<li>Even when your breath is through the nose and silent, it can be
“jagged” on the CapnoTrainer. It can even <em>feel</em> jagged to you,
like you’re manually forcing air out in little bursts, instead of it
just flowing out like it should. I don’t know how to fix this one yet,
but it seems harder to notice and harder to fix, so that’s why it comes
later. But the idea, at least for the exhale, is to just try to let go
of the breath and naturally let your diaphragm relax. It should feel
like your body is just relaxing, instead of exhaling (even though of
course you are also exhaling). As I said, I’m still experimenting with
this one.</li>
<li>This one is tricky because I notice that as I try to do it my
diaphragm can get sore if I do it wrong. In particular, it can sometimes
help to break the “silent” rule in order to get the breath smoother.
There’s a distinction between breathing in a way so that you aren’t
hypocapnic, and breathing in a way that is comfortable and not painful
to your body. Every combination is possible.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Next stage: release tension in diaphragm/throat? this might be a
specific-to-me thing, but even after my breath seems smooth enough, my
diaphragm and throat get really tense. i think i must be artificially
tensing these parts up to make my breath more quiet or something, but i
don’t consciously feel like i am exerting any effort. so it’s
confusing.</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that the above is essentially (some of the particular techniques
taught in) Buteyko breathing. The differences are: (1) pedagogical, in
that I think focusing on each step in sequence works a lot better, and
(2) whether to use a CapnoTrainer to help with some of the steps.</p>
<h2 data-number="7.2" id="any-more-stages"><span
class="header-section-number">7.2</span> Any more stages?</h2>
<p>i have a feeling that the final stage (beyond the ones i listed in
the previous section) is “exercise while doing all of the previous
ones”. this is explicitly part of some buteyko guides. vipul also (i
think independently) recommended i do this.</p>
<p>upper chest (intercostals) vs diaphragm? i feel like this one happens
automatically by doing the ones above. But for some reason this is like
the focus of many breathing gurus/meditation experts. but it’s not
necessary! in fact, i think it can be harmful to focus on your diaphragm
too much – it leads to exaggerated/forceful movement of it which can
cause overbreathing/sore muscles. like, sure, it’s fine to check your
abdomen to see that you are generally breathing with your diaphragm more
than upper chest, but it shouldn’t be a target.</p>
<p>deprecated: slow down your breath. - Your breath should already be
slower if it’s more quiet and smooth. But when you’re trying to make it
quiet or smooth, you don’t want to focus on slowing it down … that just
makes you uncomfortable because you’re not used to that much air hunger.
But once your breath is silent and smooth, it’s time to focus on slowing
it down. I still haven’t gotten to this stage so I don’t know how slow
is optimal. I suspect this is the point where an HRV monitor or such
would be handy: there might be individual variation in the optimal rate.
Notice how it’s much harder to say what “slow breath” is compared to
“nasal breath” or “silent breath” or “smooth breath”, and it is much
harder to track without an instrument like a capnometer (counting in
your head all the time seems annoying!). - UPDATE (2024-01-26): i am
thinking more and more that slowing your breath is unnecessary; it’s
like the diaphragm thing and it automatically happens. i think some of
the buteyko people also say the same thing. e.g. see <span
class="citation" data-cites="novozhilov2012">Novozhilov (2012)</span>;
in the section “Approach 3 – Just hint at reduction of airflow” there is
an illustration of a snake where slowing down the breath is a sign of
doing the exercise wrong. Under mistakes, he lists “Increasing the
frequency of your breathing or changing the length of inhalation or
exhalation.”</p>
<h1 data-number="8" id="clearing-your-nose"><span
class="header-section-number">8</span> Clearing your nose</h1>
<p>In my view, nasal breathing is essential for overcoming shortness of
breath. It’s also the very first step. There’s a lot of strategies here
so I’ll list a bunch along with what I think of them. My guess is that
different ones will work for different people, so you kind of want to
try a bunch and see what works (most of these are quite cheap).</p>
<p>I won’t say much about <em>why</em> it’s better to breathe through
your nose, as I think this is already covered pretty well in other
sources, in particular <span class="citation"
data-cites="nestor2020">Nestor (2020)</span>, which gives a pretty vivid
description of the author’s own experiment of breathing solely through
his mouth (it’s scattered throughout the book, so unfortunately I can’t
cite a specific chapter).</p>
<p>I think there are two broad ways you can react to “you need to clear
your nose”. One of them will be to say “Yeah, I hardly ever breathe
through my nose; I know I need to work on it but I don’t know how”. The
other is to say “I already breathe through my nose; I don’t think I need
any advice”. For this second type of person I want to mention my own
anecdote. Before I started really focusing on my breath, I used to think
I was already a nasal breather, but when I started paying attention I
realized that I was actually taking quite a few mouth breaths throughout
the day. A sure way to find out is to tape your mouth during the day
(even for just 15 minutes or so) and see how easy it is for you. I think
I probably went from around 80% nose breaths to 99.9% nose breaths by
following the strategies listed below (just a wild guess unfortunately
because I didn’t keep good records); during breathing attacks, I
probably went from 10–50% nose breaths to 95% nose breaths. So if you
already think you are a nasal breather, I would still try paying
attention.</p>
<p>Here are the main strategies I recommend for clearing your nose so
you can nose breathe more:</p>
<ul>
<li>Saline spray: works less well than the saline wash, but it’s a lot
less unpleasant. it doesn’t go “deep” enough, which is why it is both
less painful and doesn’t work as well. i went through about 1.5 bottles
of the NeilMed one (lime green color bottle) before my nose improved
enough that I didn’t need to use it anymore.</li>
<li>Saline wash/netipot: tried this once. it works really well for
clearing your nose, but it was also quite unpleasant. make sure to never
use tap water for this.</li>
<li>Nose strips: these were quite helpful. at first i used the RiteAid
brand ones and they worked well enough, and then i got cheaper ones from
Amazon and those also worked fine. so my guess is that there isn’t much
of a quality difference between different brands, and you can just go
with whatever. the main thing to watch for is that your skin should not
get irritated from using them. also, you should <em>immediately</em>
notice an improvement. if you don’t immediately breathe better, then
you’re either not putting them on right or the thing isn’t working.
There is also a magnetic strip made by a company called Intake
Breathing. I never used it so I don’t know how well it works, but if you
can’t get regular nose strips to work, you can look into this.</li>
<li>Nose cones: these didn’t work for me (i got them because i was
encouraged by how useful the nose strips were, and cones seemed like
reusable strips). they don’t go deep enough in the nose, so they really
only help i think if you have a deviated septum or something…</li>
<li>Patrick McKeown’s nose unblocking exercise: this is one where you
pinch your nose while holding your breath, and swaying or walking around
as you do that. I tried this back when my nose was stuffier, and it
didn’t work very well for me, but i also didn’t try very hard to get it
working (i just followed one of his videos).</li>
<li>Antihistamine spray (e.g., azelastine): my guess is azelastine did
nothing for me. but maybe it helped a bit with reducing mucus production
during the night. i never tried olopatadine (the more famous
antihistamine nasal spray) because my insurance doesn’t cover it.</li>
<li>Steroid spray (e.g. Flonase): i would stay away from these, unless
you already know they work well for you. definitely try all the other
ones in the list first. note that there are different kinds of steroid
sprays and some of them are <em>very</em> bad to keep using long-term.
Flonase is supposed to be one of the safer kinds, but i only used it
once so i can’t speak to any longer-term effects.</li>
</ul>
<p>Important note: as you start breathing through your nose more, you
should find that your nose becomes less blocked even without doing these
things. I used to need the nose strips <em>a lot</em> when I first
started nasal breathing. But now I hardly need them. So these techniques
should be thought of as temporary crutches – or like training wheels on
a bicycle. They are there to help jump start your nasal breathing until
your nose is strong enough, but you shouldn’t need them forever. I had a
clear shift when I first switched to nasal breathing, and then a second
shift when I switched to <em>silent</em> nasal breathing. It seems odd
that my nose would clear up with <em>less</em> air moving through the
nose. My hypothesis is that either my health in general got better, or
maybe less air means less irritation. <span class="citation"
data-cites="mark2015deep">Lippmann (2015)</span> mentions that “the
thickness or thinness or real-time mucous production, as well as nasal
turbinate size are regulated by CO2 levels”, so that’s another possible
thing that maybe happened to me.</p>
<p>Definitely don’t get surgery, unless you’ve tried all the safe
options and nothing works. I think the mainstream medical world
understates the risks here, e.g., you should at bare minimum know about
empty nose syndrome. <span class="citation"
data-cites="nestor2020">Nestor (2020, chap. 7)</span> has a bit about
this. See also <span class="citation" data-cites="sager2024">Sager
(2024)</span> for a random encouraging anecdote that I came across on
Twitter.</p>
<p>i should say something about mouth taping as well. i don’t have any
<em>strong</em> argument again it, but i have personally not done it
(except for briefly during the day). as you improve your breathing, your
mouth should automatically close. so mouth taping is, in my view,
unnecessary in the long-term. what about the short term? after all, all
the other nose-unblocking stuff i’m recommending are short-term crutches
as well. i think in the short term maybe it’s completely fine? i was
just personally scared of using it, and never needed it. waking up in
the middle of the night gasping for air is pretty horrible (i’ve had it
happen in the past even without mouth taping).</p>
<p>my nose still sometimes feels blocked in the morning. not sure what’s
going on there, but i have a guess that the reason my one nostril plugs
up during the night is actually functional. breathing needs are reduced
during sleep because you’re just lying there and using no muscles. so
even the quiet gentle breathing style i have going during the day would
be too <em>much</em> air. so my body figures out a way to reduce the air
flow, which is to block out the one nostril. this is why my nostril is
plugged up, but i seem to be breathing solely through the nose the whole
night, even if things are blocked! <em>and</em> it’s also why as soon as
i wake up, the mucus clears up, because my body realizes “wait, now i’m
awake and upright and active, and this is too <em>little</em> air now,
we must unblock the nostril!” So for a few moments in the morning i feel
a little uncomfortable and might have to take a few forceful nose
breaths or even sometimes mouth breaths, but then my body adjusts within
30 minutes to an hour and i’m ok again.</p>
<p>i should eventually say something about nose cleaning – whether to
pick, blow, etc. i tend to have a habit of blowing my nose when i feel
too much watery mucus build up, and then i pat the insides with tissue
paper. but this is probably not good. i’ve heard the inside lining of
the nose is quite delicate and you should never pick or clean with a
tissue. it’s just kind of annoying to feel the sensation of the stuck
mucus (how do you remove the blobs without picking them?) Even with a
nasal spray i still have wet blobs sticking around.</p>
<h2 data-number="8.1"
id="what-to-do-when-you-have-a-cold-or-your-body-is-otherwise-producing-a-lot-of-mucus"><span
class="header-section-number">8.1</span> What to do when you have a cold
(or your body is otherwise producing a lot of mucus)</h2>
<p>starting 2024-03-16 i’ve been taking nystatin to treat a candida
overgrowth. this has caused a lot of classic die-off reactions in me,
the most relevant of which here is a lot of mucus production in my
sinuses. this makes it impossible for me to nasal breathe sometimes. so
i’ve been thinking, “what can you do, if you get a cold or similar where
your nose is just clogged up semi-acutely (i.e. over the course of days
or a few weeks)?”</p>
<p>one response is something like “don’t worry about it, anything you do
in such a short span of time is meaningless compared to all the rest of
your life”. but this is unsatisfying since it’s pretty unpleasant to not
be able to breathe (and in my case, it was so bad for about ~3 nights
that i had trouble sleeping as well).</p>
<p>some solutions i’ve used:</p>
<ul>
<li>neilmed spray – this is working well when the mucus is only kind of
annoying. but at my peak, i would use it and then would breathe well for
3 minutes, then the mucus would come back.</li>
<li>blowing my nose a lot – this was my main strategy, but i think i
overdid it at times because i started seeing some blood mixed in my
mucus.</li>
<li>lying down on my sides instead of back (this was useful on the worst
nights).</li>
<li>learn to breathe through your mouth in the least disruptive way
possible. rather than gulping or straining for air, just try to breathe
softly, as if you are breathing through your nose.</li>
</ul>
<p>other ideas i haven’t tried yet:</p>
<ul>
<li>NAC</li>
<li>raised pillow/slanted bed – i think this would have been useful on
the nights when i had trouble sleeping.</li>
</ul>
<h1 data-number="9" id="techniques-vs-habits"><span
class="header-section-number">9</span> Techniques vs habits</h1>
<p>One of the disagreements I’ve seen in the breathing world is the
emphasis between techniques vs habits. Those on the techniques side
(such as anxiety specialists and Buteyko practitioners) present various
techniques you can use when you are stressed, anxious, or have breathing
difficulty. Those on the habits side (such as Peter Litchfield) say that
techniques are mere bandage covering up a dysfunctional breathing habit,
and that the solution is to unlearn the old habits and introduce new
habits.</p>
<p>(actually i think <em>some</em> buteyko people have basically the
same views as me.)</p>
<p>I find myself somewhere in between these two views. In a sense, I
think both sides are right, and it’s actually quite important to
understand what’s going on here. Techniques are a way of
<em>learning</em> a thing. Once you’ve learned it, you don’t need to
“follow a technique” anymore, it’s just a part of you. But having it
verbally, explicitly, legibly, outlined is a useful step in actually
learning the thing initially. You follow the technique, you get anxious
about whether you’re doing it right, you get obsessed about it, you get
good at it, and then finally you get bored of it. It’s all part of the
<em>overlearning</em> process. Once your bodymind digests it, it poops
out the scaffolding of the technique and you can just Do The Thing. See
also the four stages of competence <span class="citation"
data-cites="fourstageswikipedia">(Wikipedia contributors
2023)</span>.</p>
<p>So yes, do the techniques. Learn them so well that you get bored of
them and forget about them. Find the technique that you can do all day
long, such that the technique <em>is</em> the habit.</p>

<!--

From Vipul: """btw I'd love for you to expand more on what capnometers measure, particularly this related cluster of ideas:

(1) "end tidal CO2 is interesting only insofar as it approximates your alveolar CO2 -- it's not intended to be a reflection of the nature of that particular outbreath"
(2) "end tidal CO2 should be measured as of the end of a normal outbreath, as 'tidal' refers to normal breathing"
(3) "you can fake getting a high reading by forcefully breathing out more but that's just cheating, because by the time you're on your outbreath, the 'correct' reading for that outbreath is already predetermined"
"""
-->
<p>[TODO: fill out this section. It should be about how to use the
capnometer well. maybe include my list of “things to try on the
capnometer”. talk about what the ideal breathing curve should look
like.]</p>
<p>Given how expensive capnometers are (and potentially difficult to
access as well, if you don’t happen to have anyone near you who can rent
them out), you might think they are not worth it. I think it’s fine to
be skeptical of them. I personally made <em>some</em> substantial
progress without a capnometer, but then 1–2 months after switching to
nasal breathing I hit a plateau where I was still having significant
shortness of breath while talking (and okay levels of shortness of
breath while just sitting quietly). It was only after getting access to
a capnometer that I had a second big shift in my breathing. See the
section <a href="#the-unreasonable-effectiveness-of-capnometers">The
unreasonable effectiveness of capnometers</a> for more about why I think
they are useful. But also, definitely try fixing your breathing without
a capnometer first, and just see how far you can get! (reminder that i
don’t sell or rent out capnometers, so i don’t benefit either way from
your decision.)</p>
<p>the other important thing about capnometers: taking Control Pauses is
frankly scary to me, and <em>some</em> people also seem to get
unpleasant side effects when they do it (even when they’re doing it
correctly – artour rakhimov talks the most about this, of the people
i’ve read). so a capnometer is a way to measure progress in a completely
safe way. (update (2024-02-25): i think i’ve warmed up to taking CP
measurements a bit more now. the key is that if you’re doing is
correctly, then you let go of your nose on the moment of the first
inkling that you need a breath, way way way before any discomfort.
people have a tendency to hold on too long, as a way of impressing
themselves or others, because they want to feel like they are healthy.
if your CP is half a second, then so be it. the important thing is that
over time, no matter how small your initial measurements are, they will
improve. i do still think some people get weird negative symptoms even
if they correctly implement the CP, and this probably includes me, so
even though i’m warming up to the idea a bit more, i am not planning to
start <em>daily</em> measurements of my CP, although i will probably
check it once every few weeks maybe, just to see if it’s still causing
problems.)</p>
<p>TODO: what the heck do you do when your baseline CO<sub>2</sub> is
normal according to the capnometer, but you still have that slight air
hunger at all times (like, it’s subtle enough that i wouldn’t have even
logged it in my symptom tracker before), and it’s been over a week since
you’ve been in this state (so bicarbonate levels should have adjusted by
now)? that’s the place i am in now (2024-01-29), and i’m not quite sure
where to go from here. maybe trying to have this same breathing as i’m
doing light exercise? or practice maintaining good breathing while i’m
talking (my CO<sub>2</sub> goes down and i feel more out of breath when
i talk, although it’s gotten better as my baseline CO<sub>2</sub> has
gone up)? or do i need to go into more advanced buteyko exercises like
reduced breathing and breath holds? there was that thing in <span
class="citation" data-cites="breathingdisordersbookchapter1">Chaitow,
Bradley, and Gilbert (2014, 6)</span> Box 1.1 which says “General levels
of deconditioning (the opposite of aerobic fitness) lead to altered
forms of energy production (anaerobic glycolysis) that encourages
acidosis – hence a greater tendency to hyperventilation” so it’s
possible i am also just deconditioned, and if i can just exercise more
each day, everything will sort itself out. (as i write this i’ve only
been going on walks of like 10–35 minutes in length and some stretches
throughout the day. i used to run more but that routine keeps getting
disrupted.)</p>
<h2 data-number="10.1"
id="the-unreasonable-effectiveness-of-capnometers"><span
class="header-section-number">10.1</span> The unreasonable effectiveness
of capnometers</h2>
<p>One might naively expect that capnometers would be useless, since
they don’t actually <em>do</em> anything to your breathing. All of the
breathing changes you make are ones you make yourself, and the
capnometer just tells you what your CO<sub>2</sub> levels are without
affecting them. One might thus conclude that capnometers are useless. I
don’t have a great reply to this – in fact, some people seem to get
better just by doing Buteyko breathing “blind” (i.e., without seeing
their breathing curve using a capnometer). So clearly it <em>is</em>
possible to do the same things without a capnometer. (Even Peter
Litchfield admits this to some extent.<a href="#fn3"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>)
But in my case, it was only after I got a capnometer that I saw rapid
progress. Here I will try to build a model of <em>why</em> having a
capnometer is so useful.</p>
<p>My model of why capnometers are so “unreasonably effective” is
basically that with Buteyko breathing, part of the problem is that even
if you make progress, you can never know if you’re pushing so hard that
you’ve overshot your CO<sub>2</sub> and are now having too much CO2. You
can’t really avoid this problem because both too low CO<sub>2</sub> and
too high CO<sub>2</sub> feel pretty much exactly the same – air hunger.
So a capnometer is what actually lets you know for sure whether you are
undershooting, just right, or overshooting.</p>
<p>It’s just super helpful to <em>see</em> what your breath looks like.
Buteyko breathing can feel <em>scary</em> because you don’t know if
you’re going too hard and might be harming yourself. Hooking yourself up
to a capnometer tells you whether your CO<sub>2</sub> levels are
normal.</p>
<p>one of the things i’m still trying to figure out is, supposedly
Konstantin Buteyko originally had various machines to measure
CO<sub>2</sub> or whatever, but then they were destroyed, so then he was
forced to come up with the Control Pause as the sort of replacement
metric (update(2024-02-10): actually, after reading the “destruction of
the laboratory” book, i think this isn’t quite right. buteyko already
had CP as a tool when he still had access to the combine-complexator,
which is why he could make charts showing how certain pCO<sub>2</sub>
levels correspond to certain CP lengths). but what i’m wondering is,
what did his machines measure? was it just end-tidal CO<sub>2</sub>? and
if so, then what did he do after people reached a normal 40 mmHg of
pCO<sub>2</sub>? was that the end of treatment? or did he try to push
the CO<sub>2</sub> even higher? Update(2024-02-10): See <span
class="citation" data-cites="altukhovcharts">Altukhov (2009)</span>. for
some reason, the CO<sub>2</sub> measurements are super high, and so
apparently he just kept going until people reached the high CPs and high
CO<sub>2</sub>s.</p>
<p>all of the above being said, one of my goals with this document is to
be able to write down instructions that are so precise that i could hand
it to my past self who has no access to a capnometer and still
completely cure air hunger. there will be a lot more guesswork/“feeling
around blind” going on, but if the instructions are good enough then
they should still work.</p>

<h1 data-number="11" id="breathing-exercises"><span
class="header-section-number">11</span> Breathing exercises</h1>
<p>Reminder that none of these exercises will work if you can’t breathe
through your nose comfortably. See the section <a
href="#clearing-your-nose">Clearing your nose</a> for how to unblock
your nose.</p>
<p>one of the things i’ve personally found frustrating is when people
say “just do buteyko” or they link to a video with super vague
instructions. so, at the risk of overfitting to my own experience, i’m
going to give pretty precise instructions for exercises and
aspirationally try to make them be difficult to misinterpret.</p>
<p>it’s probably overwhelming to see all these exercises and giant walls
of text. one of the nice things about working with a breathing coach is
that they will guide you by only introducing one technique/exercise each
week or so, so that at any given moment, you have <em>one</em> new thing
to work with that you are trying to integrate into your practice. so a
challenge for me is: if the reader isn’t going to be working with a
coach (which is presumably why they are interested in this document),
then how can i make the exercise sequence friendly to them? i really
need some sort of timeline or flowchart that can be followed, so that as
little thought as possible needs to go into making decisions. it’s all
laid out, you just follow a recipe.</p>
<p>unfortunately the theory given in the section <a
href="#the-biological-basis-of-shortness-of-breath">The biological basis
of shortness of breath</a> only says <em>that</em> you should breathe
less to build back the CO<sub>2</sub> levels over time, but not
<em>how</em>. The exercises given here are much more an art than a
science. I’m most just writing from personal experience about what
worked best for me. The only way you will know for sure if you are
raising your CO<sub>2</sub> levels is to get a capnometer and measure
your own levels.</p>
<h2 data-number="11.1"
id="main-practice-relaxed-silent-nasal-breathing"><span
class="header-section-number">11.1</span> Main practice: relaxed silent
nasal breathing</h2>
<p>This one is most similar to <span class="citation"
data-cites="rakhimov2013advanced">Rakhimov (2013, sec. 4.6, “Relaxing
the diaphragm (Buteyko relaxed breathing exercise)”)</span>, but Neil
Tranter also has a similar video <span class="citation"
data-cites="tranter2023relaxed">(Tranter 2023)</span>. <span
class="citation" data-cites="novozhilov2012">Novozhilov (2012)</span>
has similar exercises too (e.g., Exercise 1). I recommend
reading/watching these other sources to get these other people’s takes
on the material; they are, in my opinion, all pointing to the same
thing, gesturing at that thing in different words.</p>
<p>Exercise instructions: sit upright in a comfortable way. Breathe
silently through your nose. Then just try to make sure the exhale is
done in a completely relaxed way, where your whole body (but esp
diaphragm) relaxes. You are <em>not</em> pushing the air out. Just a
whole-body relaxation on every exhale. On each exhale scan <em>one</em>
body part for tenseness: shoulders? torso? legs? etc. Just focus on one
body part at a time, and try to relax it on the exhale, and keep it
relaxed. The idea of this exercise is that just by relaxing the exhale,
your breathing should slow down (but don’t try to artificially slow down
your breathing) and so it actually <em>is</em> a (mild) reduced
breathing exercise even though it just seems like a relaxation one. Do
this for 15 minutes or so. As you’re doing this exercise, you don’t want
to be forcefully inhaling, trying to take in “good” breaths – your
inhales are silent, after all. (If your air hunger gets so extreme that
you feel like you’re suffocating, then of course it’s okay to take a
forceful emergency rescue breath, but this also means your silent
breathing was too shallow, possibly artificially restricted, or maybe
you are not ready for this exercise yet and need to do one of the
intermediate/temporary exercises.)</p>
<p>Attention drifting during the exercise is a <em>good</em> thing
because you want to make sure this style of breathing becomes a
<em>habit</em> (rather than only occurring when you are consciously
executing the instructions). You want your mind to drift away from your
breath, as a way of giving yourself small opportunities to see if you
can maintain the same breathing pattern even when you are not paying
attention. The important point is that whenever you realize you have
drifted and you’re aware of your breathing again, you want to gently
check to make sure you’re still doing the completely relaxed exhale, and
that your body isn’t tense. You can even try to intentially pay
attention to something else, to distract yourself, so that you can check
back on your breath to see what it has been doing.</p>
<p>The whole exercise is basically juggling your attention in this way:
Is my inhale silent or as quiet as I can manage without tensing up? Is
my exhale completely relaxed? Are all of my body parts relaxed (except
spine, to keep an upright posture)?</p>
<p>If you have trouble relaxing your exhale or knowing whether you are
relaxing your exhale, try the <a
href="#intermittent-technique-double-inhale-technique">Intermittent
technique: Double inhale technique</a> or try artificially slowing down
just the first part of your exhale. These two techniques should give you
an easier time relaxing the exhale so you will know what relaxation
feels like.</p>
<p>Your hands may warm up a bit, and this seems like evidence that the
exercise is working.</p>
<p>note that i use the word “silent” rather than “quiet” because for a
long time i thought my breathing was quiet, but it turned out my
breathing was still making quite a bit of noise compared to what i
<em>could</em> do. i don’t want others to make the same mistake i did.
if your hearing is normal, you should not be able to hear your
breathing. if you are hard of hearing, then maybe get someone else to
check for you.</p>
<p>the goal is to eventually be breathing in this way all the time. so
it’s a “technique” but also it is going to become a habit.</p>
<p>It’s okay to have mild air hunger throughout the exercise. But you
don’t want too much. While your CO<sub>2</sub> tolerance is still very
low, you might only be able to do the exercise for a short time, or you
might need to do things like artificially lengthening the inhale.</p>
<p>an open question for me currently is: after you do this conscious
relaxed silent breathing, you will build up some mild air hunger. now,
<em>after</em> you complete the exercise, how long should you “keep”
that air hunger going? should you feel free to just take a slightly
deeper breath and “clear” the air hunger, or should you keep it going
for some time (if so, how long?), or should you just try to keep it
going as long as possible? i think trying to keep up the silent
breathing with slight air hunger for long enough periods tends to cause
a sudden burst of anxiety for me, like a sense of panic at not being
able to breathe. so i think that’s probably not the right thing to do.
but it’s confusing because i go from feeling totally comfortable with
the slight air hunger to suddenly feeling panicky. <span
class="citation" data-cites="mark2015deep">Lippmann (2015)</span> says
“This process [raising CO<sub>2</sub> tolerance over time] is long and
finicky and can cause very unpleasant symptoms. Less is more; barely
knowing whether you’re doing anything is best. You can also trigger
panic attacks or asthma attacks if you’re susceptible.” Another thought
is to, whenever possible when taking deeper breaths, to do so in more
Buteyko-aligned ways, e.g., through the nose and as gently as possible.
So don’t satisfy the urge for a deeper breath by inhaling with your
mouth or yawning or being super forceful about it, just try to gently
incline towards a deeper breath, a slight force with your nose. NOTE:
this may not be possible at first, e.g., i had to get to silent nasal
breathing in order to take “good” breaths with little force through my
nose. when i was still mouth breathing some of the time, i always had to
take a good breath through my mouth. then when i started nose breathing
(but loudly), i could take good breaths occasionally through my nose,
but only by loudly sniffing in. so there’s a gradual “handoff” where the
old normal becomes the new “rescue breath” method.</p>
<p>Try slouching too as you do this exercise, and in general experiment
with your posture. Your diaphragm will give you feedback on which
postures work best. For example, when I slouch as I do this exercise, I
notice my diaphragm can’t move as well (both for inhale and exhale).
Being too upright also makes it seem like my whole torso is too “stiff”.
So some intermediate posture seems to work best for me, but idk yet if
this is optimal.</p>
<p>I think this exercise might be “breathing-complete” in the sense that
it’s the only thing you need to cure shortness of breath – but I am
still actively testing out this hypothesis. i also suspect this exercise
is “universal” in the sense that it is particularly easy to stumble
onto. i sort of (with a bit of help) stumbled onto it while using the
capnometer. the buteyko people also recommend this (or slight variant)
exercise for beginners.</p>
<p>relaxing completely is harder than it seems. I have a tendency to
“relax” by like forcing my body to collapse, and that is not actually
relaxation – on the capnometer i can actually see i am failing, because
my CO<sub>2</sub> will go from like 38 to 34. you should not feel any
strain or “tug” at all in your abdomen. i don’t know how to convey the
actual precise instructions necessary to do this; i personally am just
getting feedback from the capnometer. when the capnometer tells me my
CO<sub>2</sub> just went down from the new thing i tried, i’m like “ok,
i guess that’s not the right way to do it”, and go back to my baseline
breathing style, and then try another thing.</p>
<p>for me, even on 2024-01-29, doing this exercise for 10 mins caused a
mild suffocation-like reaction after about 5 mins, where i freaked out
and stood up and had to take a few (unsuccessful/unsatisfying) mouth
breaths, and then had to like just let my body do whatever for a few
breaths, and then try to get in some good nasal breaths. after that, i
was able to return to the exercise again, but i had to keep indulging
good breaths. idk, this exercise is a lot harder than it seems! it’s
weird though because i <em>feel</em> like i’m just doing this throughout
the day, but i never get this suffocation reaction. so i wonder if it’s
just that i’m indulging good breaths throughout the day, but during this
exercise i don’t, and that’s the crucial difference? i think i should
start lower, like do this for 2 mins without indulging, then next day go
up to 3 mins, etc?</p>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="capnolearningbook">Litchfield and
Reamer (2023, 57)</span> has an interesting prompt, “Do you feel air
hunger before the end of the exhale?” It made me pause because I always
thought I continuously have air hunger, but actually, paying attention,
I don’t have it on the inhale, even if it’s soft. Then as the exhale
progresses it slowly mounts, in a subtle way. I’ve noticed that paying
precise attention to when the air hunger comes one actually diminishes
the air hunger.</p>
<p>eventually, i think the goal is to do this exercise while walking,
then while jogging, biking, etc.</p>
<p>another point: you don’t want to just move your diaphragm. natural
breathing actually involves movement of the whole torso, from upper
chest to ribs to back to diaphragm. if you find that you are only moving
your diaphragm, then this is a sign that one or both of two things are
happening: (1) you’re exaggerating the movement of the diaphragm; and/or
(2) you’re artificially suppressing movement of the rest of your body,
tightening it up.</p>
<p>it might be helpful to do this exercise with a naked upper body and
staring at a mirror, so that you can see exactly which parts of your
torso are moving in what ways (you can also try it in the shower but
your neck will be bent if you want to look down at your torso).
alternatively you could put your hands on various parts of your chest
and feel the movement.</p>
<p>any reduction in breathing <em>must</em> come from relaxation,
<em>not</em> from tension/control. this is a good video <a
href="https://iv.datura.network/watch?v=uvWSwxKUKlA"
class="uri">https://iv.datura.network/watch?v=uvWSwxKUKlA</a> (that i
totally did not appreciate in the beginning, because i wasn’t even
trying to do any reduced breathing. but what i’ve realized is that
relaxation=reduced, at least if your breathing is awful like mine. and
sometimes you consciously or unconsciously try to make your breathing
more silent, and you really don’t want to do that by tensing up.)</p>
<p>it helps to have a guided meditation audio type thing to periodically
listen along to as you do this practice. what I especially like doing is
to start out by listening to a recording to prime myself, and then after
the recording ends i just keep going on my own. i’ve been using the
breathing normalization meditations from <a
href="https://buteykobreathingcenter.com/products/breathing-normalization-meditations-mp3"
class="uri">https://buteykobreathingcenter.com/products/breathing-normalization-meditations-mp3</a>
(my favorite recording is called “you just landed on this planet”) but i
don’t think there’s anything super special about these. visualization
seems to help, e.g. imagining the air as having a pleasant but strong
aroma (if you are not allergic to pollen, it might even work to go get
some flowers or go out in nature and do the exercise there), so i would
try to find one that incorporates such visualizations. but different
things might work for different people here…</p>
<p>i think formally scheduled sessions (where you actually sit down with
a timer and focus on just your breathing, while following audio or video
instructions, and then recording in a spreadsheet) is actually very
important. i think this might be why i didn’t see any progress in my
breathing symptoms during all of february 2024. it’s very easy to
convince yourself that you’re “doing buteyko all the time”. but if you
actually sit down and do a real session, you will notice your SpO2
readings go down (from like 99–100% to 97–98%) and your hands get
warmer. and this is a sign that the session did something real, over and
above what you thought you were already doing. my working theory right
now is that it’s easy to miss those slightly bigger breaths you
occasionally take, and think that you didn’t take them, or to be
breathing with just a bit of sound rather than complete silence. but
when you’re doing a formal session, you’re more careful and prevent
those from happening.</p>
<p>i should note however that i don’t regret avoiding formal sessions
for so long – i have a preference for just doing what my body and mind
want to do and not forcing myself to do anything. formal sessions seemed
aversive because there’s so much audio/video to choose from and no one
ever explained why i should do formal sessions rather than just trying
to change my habits. but at this point i think i’m still missing
something and so i feel more motivated to try formal sessions.</p>
<p>2024-06-03: this practice is so simple but so difficult. it can feel
like there’s barely anything to it, and you might deceive yourself that
you are always doing it. i kind of had the mistaken impression that i’m
“always doing relaxed silent nasal breathing”. but then i actually sat
down yesterday and listened to “you just landed on this planet” again,
and kept going for like an hour (the recording itself is only 9 minutes
long). i felt so relaxed afterwards, hands warm, salivating, and like my
breathing cleared up. then today my diaphragm wasn’t tensing up like
normal, and i was able to talk for a lot longer! same thing happened
this evening, my hands are warm (pulse oximeter recorded a perfusion
index of 3.2%, when usually I am at like 0.5%), I’m salivating, feeling
so relaxed that i’m kind of sleepy. this buteyko stuff is so real, it’s
crazy. but it’s also difficult to get right – while listening to “you
just landed on this planet”, my core/chest/diaphragm area felt tight,
and i couldn’t get it to relax until well after the recording ended, by
distracting myself by doing other than paying attention to my breathing.
i keep shifting my posture around, and trying different sitting styles,
to see which postures/sitting styles will lead to relaxation in which
parts of my body. “belly soft like jelly” is hard. also, i am getting
the thing again where even as i reduce my breathing, i can get “good”
breaths in by like, “stretching” my insides somehow? normally i’d have
to strain with my muscles or open my mouth to get such “good” breaths
in, but i’m doing it almost accidentally, as the good breaths are
“offered” to me. this also shows how it’s ok to leave breathing stuff on
the table for several months (i think last time i really focused much on
it was like february? march?) and come back to it. it’ll still be here,
waiting.</p>
<p>also many buteyko places will tell you to do like 3 shorter sessions
per day, but i am finding it easier to just do one longer one at night,
like 1-2 hours before i want to go to sleep. i think it will help with
going to sleep on time too. another benefit of doing it before bed is
that you are more likely to carry good habits of breathing into your
sleep (and hopefully have it still going when you wake up).</p>
<p>2024-06-05: apparently i haven’t mentioned this anywhere in this
document yet, but i think perfusion index on a pulse oximeter (only some
pulse oximeters have perfusion index as a measurement, so if you want to
try this, make sure to buy one that does have it) gives a fairly good
indication of how warm your hands are/how much bloodflow there is to
your finger tips, which is one of the ways you can tell whether the
exercise is working. I like to take before and after measurements on the
pulse oximeter.</p>
<h2 data-number="11.2"
id="introductory-exercise-many-small-breath-holds"><span
class="header-section-number">11.2</span> Introductory exercise: Many
small breath holds</h2>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="tranter2022breathhold">Tranter
(2022)</span> – the actual exercise starts around 7:46. also note that
he counts kind of fast. i think his “5 second” count is actually more
like 3.5–4 seconds (i should verify). 5 seconds is actually quite a long
time to hold your breath, if you have air hunger! don’t be discouraged
if you can’t do an actual 5 seconds. even tranter’s count down is enough
to get you used to the idea that deliberately holding your breath a bit
isn’t going to kill you.</p>
<p>i think the main value of this exercise is at the start, to get used
to very small amounts of air hunger, to be like “ok, yeah, this is
uncomfortable but it won’t kill me”.</p>
<p>you can try doing this both when you’re feeling mostly ok and when
you’re having more trouble breathing. for me it was very easy when i was
feeling ok, but quite challenging when i was having trouble breathing
(so much so that i’d have to take “rescue” mouth breaths every few
breath holds). you don’t want to follow the video so literally that you
feel like you’re suffocating; the idea again, is to just get used to
doing breath holds and intentionally building up mild air hunger. so
this is more of a <em>psychological</em> exercise than a physiological
exercise.</p>
<p>i currently don’t recommend doing longer breath holds. i think it
helps for some people, but i think there is more risk, and i am pretty
sure it’s not required for fixing air hunger.</p>
<h2 data-number="11.3"
id="intermittent-technique-double-inhale-technique"><span
class="header-section-number">11.3</span> Intermittent technique: Double
inhale technique</h2>
<p>you take two relatively quick inhales, then exhale in a relaxed
way.</p>
<p>This one was shown to me by my breathing coach. I’ve found this quite
useful for getting my body to relax the exhale. i have no idea why it
works, but somehow it’s just easier to exhale in a relaxed way from a
more full inhale.</p>

<h2 data-number="11.5"
id="intermittent-technique-watching-automatic-breaths"><span
class="header-section-number">11.5</span> Intermittent technique:
watching automatic breaths</h2>
<p>Usually I have found that if I start paying attention to my breaths,
my breaths become consciously controlled ones, i.e., non-automatic. This
brings up a question of whether it is possible to “study” your own
automatic breaths without controlling them (e.g., to find what your
natural breathing rhythm is, or because your automatic breaths are
better).</p>
<p>One natural idea is to just record yourself all the time, or to have
someone watch you all the time, so that they can catch you when you’re
not focused on your breaths. But this requires a lot of setup and I am
not even sure that your breaths will be the same when hooked up to a
machine.</p>
<p>If you feel like even when you are trying to just let the breath
naturally happen (when doing the main exercise) that you are somehow
controlling or manipulating your breath (which expresses itself as
discomfort/air hunger, pain in your diaphragm, a feeling that your
throat is subtly being choked, etc.), then this exercise might help.</p>
<p>Exercise instructions: lightly tap your teeth kind of as if you are
chattering from being cold. You can tap along to some song you like.
What I’ve noticed is that since I have to tap along to the song, I can’t
control my breath as well, <em>but</em> I can still “watch” the breaths
without controlling them. If you have more musical talent or experience
then it may require a more complex pattern to distract you away enough
from controlling your breath.</p>
<p>By tapping in a simple rhythm lightly with my teeth, like
<code>. ... .. . . ..</code> or something repeatedly, if I focus on the
tapping, then my breathing becomes automatic. But because the teeth are
close enough to the nose, you can kind of “watch” your nose
automatically breathing.</p>
<p>One tricky thing is that when I tried this while walking, I found
myself wanting to breathe at the same rhythm I was tapping with my
teeth, which is not what we want.</p>
<p>I have found better luck when lying down on my back and just tapping
with my teeth lightly, and watching my breaths.</p>
<h2 data-number="11.6"
id="temporary-exercise-soft-smooth-slow-long-inhales"><span
class="header-section-number">11.6</span> Temporary exercise: soft
smooth slow long inhales</h2>
<p>TODO: explain this exercise. it’s transitory because eventually
(within like a week or two) you want to switch to the relaxed silent
breathing. this exercise is a crutch for when relaxed silent breathing
is too hard.</p>
<h2 data-number="11.7" id="temporary-exercise-soft-long-exhales"><span
class="header-section-number">11.7</span> Temporary exercise: soft long
exhales</h2>
<p>this is the counterpart to the previous exercise.</p>
<p>i think the idea with these two exercises is that you’re focused on
just <em>one</em> half of the breath, and trying to do that half
correctly. but the other half you can just do whatever. eventually, you
will be able to just do the main exercise (i.e., both halves). in fact,
you should eventually notice that slowing one half of the breath (esp
inhale?) will lead to slowing the other half too.</p>
<p>one you start doing the main exercise, these transitory ones will
feel extremely unnatural.</p>
<h2 data-number="11.8"
id="intermittent-exercise-observe-your-breathing-after-waking-up"><span
class="header-section-number">11.8</span> Intermittent exercise: observe
your breathing after waking up</h2>
<p>breathing during sleep is purely automatic. many people with air
hunger report that their breathing is unusually okay during sleep and
when they first wake up, but then becomes dysregulated soon after waking
up. so the idea here is: as soon as you wake up, try to watch your
breathing <em>without trying to change it</em>. how are you breathing
when it’s completely automatic? which muscles are you using to expand
the chest area? are you “sucking in” the air mentally to a particular
part of your body? what’s the pace of breathing? how do you feel? do you
feel air hunger?</p>
<p>it’s ok if you can only do this for a few seconds before you take
control of your breathing and it gets worse. each morning is a new
chance.</p>
<p>“automatic” does not necessarily mean “perfect” – a lot of what we do
automatically is carried over from our conscious breathing patterns.
(e.g. i’ve noticed that as I consciously altered my breathing to be
better, it carried over into my unconscious/automatic breathing and that
got better too.) BUT i think for a lot of people, their automatic
breathing is sort of “one step ahead” of their conscious breathing. so
the point of this exercise is to figure out what that next step is.</p>
<h2 data-number="11.9" id="intermittent-technique-distraction"><span
class="header-section-number">11.9</span> Intermittent technique:
distraction</h2>
<p>when you feel out of breath (e.g., after talking) and just sitting
there quietly isn’t helping, this is a sign that you’re still somehow,
on some level, interfering with your breath and trying to control it.
one way out of this, at least as a temporary measure,<a href="#fn4"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> is
to just totally distract yourself in some way so that you’re not paying
attention to your breathing at all. this will tend to “reset” your
unconscious breathing pattern, back into a “good” state. you can try any
of the following, or even anything else that you can think of:</p>
<ul>
<li>pace around the room (note: you probably don’t want to go on a
<em>walk</em>, which might make you exert too much and then you might
feel a bit out of breath for a different reason, at least, if you happen
to be deconditioned like I am)</li>
<li>go make some tea</li>
<li>go prepare some food to eat</li>
<li>go pee</li>
<li>read something</li>
<li>watch something, like a youtube video or movie</li>
<li>play a video game</li>
<li>talk to someone (maybe using body language, sign language, gestures,
or writing), hug someone, ask someone to hug you</li>
<li>pet an animal (assuming you don’t have allergies)</li>
<li>take a nap</li>
<li>brushing your teeth/flossing (personally I tend to notice my
breathing is better after I brush my teeth and floss at night)</li>
</ul>
<p>you can even combine any of the above, like pacing around
<em>while</em> listening to a podcast.</p>
<p>you probably don’t want to do something that requires a lot of mental
exertion (like reading a difficult book) or that induces stress (like
watching a thriller film). you want something that is distracting enough
that you’re not thinking about your breath, but also something that is
“ordinary” enough that you’re not unconsciously manipulating your breath
in weird ways. a mild distraction, not an engrossing activity.</p>
<p>also possibly just for me, but eating/drinking is kind of stressful
because i don’t know how to coordinate the moments when i need to hold
my breath when i swallow. so for me, eating food would not be a good
distraction.</p>
<h1 data-number="12" id="posture"><span
class="header-section-number">12</span> Posture</h1>
<p>I’m appreciating posture more now – it really makes silent relaxed
breathing easier when you have better posture. But “good posture” is
maybe not what society thinks is good posture, but whatever feels
comfortable to you and allows for good breathing.</p>
<p>The Buteyko people also emphasize posture, but I have not read much
about what they say. what i’ve seen is basically “sit at the edge of a
hard surface with back straight”.</p>
<p>i still have a lot to learn here. apparently some posture techniques
can be quite dangerous (can even cause die-off reactions??)</p>
<p>what can sometimes <em>feel</em> like air hunger might just be your
abdomen being compressed due to slouching. sitting up a bit straighter
can reduce the air hunger feeling. (this doesn’t work most of the
time)</p>
<p>i think posture matters more the lighter your breathing becomes.
during reduced breathing exercises i think it’s especially important. i
notice if i’m slouched my breathing is more forceful. the problem is
that i get back pain if i am sitting upright for too long (in supposedly
“good” posture). so i need to figure what’s optimal in the long run.
there’s got to be a way to get both good breathing and good posture and
no back pain; i just don’t know how yet.</p>
<p>i’ve been kind of going through a loop of {feeling tired -&gt; slouch
-&gt; feeling like i can’t breathe as well -&gt; sit up straight}. and
then also sitting in different ways (cross-legged, seiza, normal,
against back rest, not against back rest, which gives you like 6
combinations, and if you add slouch/straight then that’s 12
configurations on the chair). and i think this is probably good, to just
be changing posture and sitting style all the time, like every few
minutes.</p>
<h1 data-number="13" id="breathing-synthesis"><span
class="header-section-number">13</span> Breathing synthesis</h1>
<p>My synthesis = “Buteyko method” + “Alexander Technique” + Capnometry
biofeedback</p>
<p>or maybe:</p>
<p>My synthesis = Nasal breathing + Silent relaxed breathing + Posture +
Habits + Capnometry biofeedback</p>
<ul>
<li>Buteyko provides nasal breathing, silent breathing and a theory of
air hunger via CO<sub>2</sub> levels. I put it in quotes because this is
probably a vast oversimplification of the Buteyko method – but I only
needed this much of the theory.</li>
<li>“Alexander Technique” is what I mean by just allowing the breath to
happen: smooth, not jerky. “Allowing the breath to happen” rather than
doing the breath. And also making the good breathing a <em>habit</em>
rather than “executing techniques” when you need them. Make it
automatic/autonomic/subconscious/unconscious, rather than
conscious/manual – this one might be two separate things actually (the
smooth part, and the unconscious/habit part). Some of the Buteyko people
also <em>mention</em> this, but it tends to be much more buried and not
<em>emphasized</em>. I think it really needs to be thought of as one of
the main components.</li>
<li>Capnometry biofeedback is discussed elsewhere in this document,
e.g., see the section <a
href="#the-unreasonable-effectiveness-of-capnometers">The unreasonable
effectiveness of capnometers</a>. In some sense this one is
<em>also</em> part of the Buteyko method, except that the Buteyko
community moved away from capnometry after their equipment was
destroyed/confiscated. So in some sense I am picking and choosing the
specific parts of Buteyko that I like, so it’s turning out to be less a
synthesis and more a distillation.</li>

<p>things to ask yourself, or rather, here are some things i tend to ask
myself, in no particular order, whenever i’m having more-than-my-usual

<ul>
<li>can i distract myself using one of the suggestions listed in <a
href="#intermittent-technique-distraction">Intermittent technique:
distraction</a>?</li>
<li>is the breathing difficulty coming from my nostrils being clogged or
my turbinates swelling? do i feel resistance in my nose as i breathe
(especially on the inhale, in my experience)? if so, can i use a nasal
rinse or one of the other strategies listed in <a
href="#clearing-your-nose">Clearing your nose</a>?</li>
<li>am i exhaling enough air? am i trying to just take in the next
breathe before exhaling the current breath?</li>
<li>can i soften my inhale? can i make it silent, even just for a few
breaths?</li>
<li>does my brain feel like it’s suffocating? if so, i can try to let
myself take an occasional mouth breath.</li>
<li>how does it feel to sit upright, place one hand on my upper chest
and one hand on my belly, and to just tactilely feel my breathing?</li>
<li>which part of my body is moving as i breathe? can i try to make my
body move less, or distribute the movement more evenly across my body,
so that i’m not just exaggerating movement in any one part of my
body?</li>
<li>am i slouched? can i be more upright so that the whole length of my
torso is free to expand?</li>
<li>can i change my posture? can i stand up? if i’m lying down, can i
lie on my side vs back vs belly?</li>
<li>can i check my oxygen reading using a pulse oximeter? is it 99–100%
(indicating overbreathing)?</li>
<li>am i talking too much, or exerting myself too much in some way? if
so, i can just try to drop everything, and sit or stand or lie down and
just not do anything for a while.</li>
<li>when do i feel the air hunger? is it all the time? is it only on the
exhale? is it at the end of the exhale? (peter litchfield’s question.)
Is it at the start of the inhale? is it during the inhale? (The latter
two for me seem to happen when my body is confused and doesn’t know how
to breathe.) This one tends to help me pay attention to subtle qualities
of my breathing, not just being like “I CAN’T BREATHE!!!”</li>
<li>can i listen to one of my favorite relaxation guided audio
recordings? (if you don’t have one, make it a priority and find some to
have on hand.)</li>
<li>can i get “fresher” air (even if imaginary) by going inside or
outside or to a different room or by moving away from a “pollutant”
source? is there a smell that’s bothering me? a lot of times, if you
also have anxiety about your breathing, it is helpful to do things that
might just seem like placebo, just to help your brain calm down so that
it doesn’t keep looping on and on about “what if i’m breathing in
polluted air” or whatever.</li>
<li>is my breathing <em>pattern</em> irregular? (e.g., pauses, or
breathing fast for a few breaths and then slow, or differently sized
breaths, like audible for a few breaths, then silent for a few breaths.)
can i try to make it more regular? or does it really want to be
irregular?</li>
<li>does it feel more like i’m forgetting how to breathe (and so i
should gently try to guide my body into breathing better), or like i am
controlling my breathing too much (and i should instead just let my
breathing happen on its own)? (i’ve felt both at different times and
it’s quite confusing. i suspect the first one is some sort of autonomic
dysfunction thing that i have because of my generic illness, and the
second one is a more typical air hunger thing that i have due to
overbreathing. but really, i don’t know.)</li>
<li>can i relax some part of my body, or (if some parts of my body are
already relaxed) <em>more</em> parts of my body?</li>
<li>is my heart rate also high? (for me, this tends to indicate i am
having POTS and so lying down often helps me calm down a lot.)</li>
</ul>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="acknowledgments">Acknowledgments</h1>
<p>i’ve benefited from interacting with a lot of people, in the course
of figuring out my breathing. (people who i haven’t checked with to see
if they want to be mentioned are listed as initials, unless i’m only
relying on public sources and no private interactions, which applies to
Howard Cooper.) Being acknowledged does not mean that the person agrees
with anything I wrote in the document.</p>
<ul>
<li>ML: kept mentioning buteyko breathing to me saying i should try
it.</li>
<li>Howard Cooper: While I’ve benefitted from all the sources I’m citing
in the <a href="#references">References</a>, I want to call out
especially <span class="citation" data-cites="cooper2021">Cooper
(2021)</span> as the thing that finally made the CO<sub>2</sub> stuff
click for me (though my understanding was still very incomplete) and got
me to actually start playing around with buteyko techniques.</li>
<li>CM: told me about the capnotrainer and got me excited about
capnometry biofeedback.</li>
<li>Vipul Naik helped me understand some key things about the biology of
respiration. In particular, he was the one who figured out that having a
low CO<sub>2</sub> means pH is more sensitive to slight fluctuations in
CO<sub>2</sub> levels. also for reading drafts of this document and
giving me feedback. most of the things in this document i wrote up while
discussing them with vipul.</li>
<li>DD: introduced me to JA. he was also a catalyst for me figuring out
my circadian rhythm, but that’s a whole separate topic.</li>
<li>JA: my former breathing coach; helped me get set up on the
capnotrainer, and helped me through the whole biofeedback process.</li>
<li>PL: was generous enough to spend an hour talking to me about
capnometer stuff and responding to an email.</li>

<section id="footnotes" class="footnotes footnotes-end-of-document"
role="doc-endnotes">
<hr />
<ol>
<li id="fn1"><p>This footnote is intended to prevent a potential
misconception. However, the actual details in this footnote are not
important for understanding the rest of the document, so I’ve decided to
not include it in the main text. Those with knowledge of chemistry will
remember the ideal gas law, <span class="math inline">\(PV =
nRT\)</span>, which relates the pressure <span
class="math inline">\(P\)</span>, volume <span
class="math inline">\(V\)</span>, amount of substance <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, and temperature <span
class="math inline">\(T\)</span> of a gas, with some constant <span
class="math inline">\(R\)</span> that varies depending on the units.</p>
<p>If we try to model the lungs naively based on this equation, we run
into trouble. Let’s see how that happens. During the exhale, the lungs
contract by let’s say 20%, i.e., its volume changes by a factor of <span
class="math inline">\(1 - 0.2 = 4/5\)</span>. To make up for this
decrease in volume, now pressure must increase by a factor of <span
class="math inline">\(5/4\)</span>, i.e., the pressure increases by
<span class="math inline">\(5/4 - 1 = 25\%\)</span>. The increased
pressure then expels the air, so <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>
goes down, which then makes <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> go
down again.</p>
<p>The problem is, when actually measured, the pressure in the lungs
increases by only about 1 mmHg from a baseline of 760 mmHg (the
atmospheric pressure), so the pressure in reality only increases by
about <span class="math inline">\(761/760 - 1 \approx 0.13\%\)</span>,
not 25%. Why the huge discrepancy? It is because the exhalation does not
happen in a rigid sequence like “the lungs contract all at once; the air
pressure is raised; the air flows out to neutralize the pressure
difference”. Instead, as the lungs begin to contract, the air starts
spilling out almost immediately, so as the pressure starts to build up
from the contraction, pressure also starts to neutralize from the air
escaping the lungs. So the actual pressure increase during exhalation
cannot be calculated solely from the contraction in volume; it’s instead
coming from the <em>lag</em> from when the lungs begin to contract and
when the air starts to leak out.<a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back"
role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn2"><p>By “breathing practice”, here I specifically mean
breathing practice to cure shortness of breath from over-breathing, but
it may also apply to meditative practices as well, I don’t know.<a
href="#fnref2" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn3"><p>From <span class="citation"
data-cites="capnolearningcourse">Litchfield and Reamer
(2024)</span>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You may be wondering, “can I benefit from the course without using
technology?” The answer, of course, is a resounding YES. The ultimate
objective of breathing behavior analysis work is NOT about learning to
use technology for manipulating breathing with physical techniques,
i.e., an outside-in paradigm, but rather it is about learning new
breathing habits that automatically optimize respiration, that is,
aligning breathing with respiration based on the principles of
self-regulation, an inside-out paradigm. The CapnoTrainer GO technology
is a powerful tool for making this transition from an outside-in to an
inside-out paradigm, that is, for identifying existing habits and
learning new ones.</p>
</blockquote>
<a href="#fnref3" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></li>
<li id="fn4"><p>Hopefully at some point I will figure out a better way
out of such situations. I’ve found that like 80% of the time just
sitting quietly and with decent posture and breathing silently through
the nose will dissolve the air hunger feeling to a small enough level
that I don’t even think about it. So this distraction technique is
helpful in the remaining 20% of times. But I’m hoping that I can figure
out some better, less artificial, solution for what to do in those 20%
of times.<a href="#fnref4" class="footnote-back"
