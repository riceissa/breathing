title: My thoughts on breathing, with an emphasis on dealing with chronic shortness of breath

THIS IS A DRAFT.  THIS IS NOT PERSONALIZED MEDICAL ADVICE.  USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.


# Safety

I want to make two seemingly contradictory remarks about the safety of trying various breathing techniques.

1. Because I am _already_ experiencing significant shortness of breath, just by breathing the way I already am, I have a greater appetite/tolerance for air hunger and unsafe breathing. Whether I like it or not, I am already experiencing some significant amount of risk just by existing in my current way.

2. I have the impression that a lot of breathing coaches and such don't emphasize safety enough. One of the reasons I didn't get into Buteyko breathing earlier (despite having known about it since early 2022 or so) is that I was put off by how dangerous it seemed.

When I started practicing silent nasal breathing, I got a few weird symptoms including head pressure, throat tightening (it felt as if I was being subtly choked), and possibly others. (Since I have a mysterious chronic illness, I have a daily occurrence of weird physical symptoms, so I am already quite used to dealing with random new symptoms, and it's often hard to pin down _why_ a new symptom started happening, but in the case of head pressure and throat tightening, I am pretty confident it happens because of the breathing.)

The other thing I want to say about safety.  It's not helpful when people just tell you a blanket "if you have health issues, don't attempt this". Part of _why_ I'm interested in fixing my breathing is because I already have breathing and other health issues. I shouldn't automatically be turned away from trying to solve these issues! So, I don't want to _ignore_ safety issues, but I also don't want to give useless cowardly ass-covering safety warnings. How to avoid both problems?


# The simple math of respiration (acid--base balance, bicarbonate buffer model, and the Henderson--Hasselbalch equation)

The aim of this section is to give you a useful mechanistic model of how respiration works. I will skip a lot of details because while it's helpful to know them, they aren't essential.

The central thing we're trying to explain here is: why is it that if you have shortness of breath, the right thing to do is the breathe _less_, even though your body is telling you to breathe _more_? What is going on at the chemical level when people have shortness of breath?
