# Why this document?

there has been a lot written about breathing, both in the academic literature and in self-help/meditation/mindfulness contexts. why am i adding my own words to this vast literature? what value am i adding?

I am writing basically the document I wish someone had handed to me over a decade ago when I first started to experience shortness of breath.

There's a lot written about air hunger already. the problem is that each source only seems to have a part of the solution. there's no one-stop place to get everything i need. so in some sense i'm just synthesizing and collecting everything into one place.

but also, i've noticed a lot of sources making mistakes or not fully explaining things. so i've had to think about some stuff and work it out on my own or with friends, and also by experimenting on my own.

i will be critiquing a lot of sources as i discuss them. i don't want to sound too negative -- it's only because of all these sources that i've made significant progress on overcoming my own breathing problem. but seeing how things are explained incorrectly/what can go wrong is one of the best ways to understand why something is the way it is. see [here](https://learning.subwiki.org/wiki/Importance_of_struggling_in_learning) for more on this pedagogical perspective.

note to self: this document should have a tightly focused scope. it's to explain what is going on biologically in air hunger, and then explain _how to get out of that state_. all my other random thoughts about breathing should be put somewhere else. ask: will this directly help someone who is suffering from shortness of breath?

a note for breathing experts: if you're wondering what the philosophy of this document is in a few words, check out the [Breathing synthesis] section. In short, my philosophy is the "Buteyko method" + the "Alexander Technique" + capnometry biofeedback, with the first two terms in quotes because I'm sort of doing my own bastardized versions of them, and wouldn't want to claim I am propagating the "real thing". If you don't know what any of the three terms mean, don't worry! They will all be explained in the course of this document.

# Ruling out more serious medical problems

I think as a first step, it's a good idea to rule out any standard problems with the lungs or other body organs, by e.g.\ doing a chest x-ray, pulmonary function test, blood test, etc. I will say more about what tests I got done and why. The breathing stuff I describe later in the document _might_ help with your breathing anyway, even if you have a problem with your lungs, but you definitely want to know if you do have problems and to get proper treatment for those before progressing to any breathing modification.

[TODO: add more details]


# Safety

I want to make two seemingly contradictory remarks about the safety of trying various breathing techniques.

1. Because I am _already_ experiencing significant shortness of breath, just by breathing the way I already am, I have a greater appetite/tolerance for air hunger and unsafe breathing. Whether I like it or not, I am already experiencing some significant amount of risk just by existing in my current way.

2. I have the impression that a lot of breathing coaches and such don't emphasize safety enough. One of the reasons I didn't get into Buteyko breathing earlier (despite having known about it since early 2022 or so) is that I was put off by how dangerous it seemed.

When I started practicing silent nasal breathing, I got a few weird symptoms including head pressure, throat tightening (it felt as if I was being subtly choked), and possibly others. (Since I have a mysterious chronic illness, I have a daily occurrence of weird physical symptoms, so I am already quite used to dealing with random new symptoms, and it's often hard to pin down _why_ a new symptom started happening, but in the case of head pressure and throat tightening, I am pretty confident it happens because of the breathing.)

The other thing I want to say about safety.  It's not helpful when people just tell you a blanket "if you have health issues, don't attempt this". Part of _why_ I'm interested in fixing my breathing is because I already have breathing and other health issues. I shouldn't automatically be turned away from trying to solve these issues! So, I don't want to _ignore_ safety issues, but I also don't want to give useless cowardly ass-covering safety warnings. How to avoid both problems?

i also don't want to just put a big safety warning at the start, and then not mention safety at all later on. safety will be a concern throughout. but, also, i will have a safety section here to give an overview of what you might experience.

## Accidental meditation

as you try to normalize your breath, you're constantly paying attention to the way you breathe, and that's essentially the mental motion that meditators make (at least, when they do the kind of meditation where they focus on their breath). could you be accidentally meditating by trying to fix your air hunger? is that why the intracranial pressure happens? how can we correct the breath without risking accidentally meditating?

i don't have any good answers yet. i'm still working through this myself. for the head pressure, it was somewhat bad for one day, but then after that it just got better on its own. i've also been just trying to do other stuff, so that even as i do inevitably bring my attention back to my breath to see if i'm still doing silent nasal breathing, i'm not just sitting there doing that the entire day.


# The biological basis of shortness of breath

If you followed my advice and ruled out serious medical problems with a doctor, you may be thinking there is no biological cause of your shortness of breath, that it is just all "in your head". Certainly this is what doctors kept telling _me_, that it was all due to anxiety or some other hard-to-verify physical cause like mast cell activation (primary care physician, two pulmonologists, allergist).

It turns out that there is a pretty well-understood cause of air hunger! But to understand it, we need to have a decent understanding of the chemistry of respiration; in particular we'll need to correct some misconceptions about breathing. So that's what this section is about.

The aim of this section is to give you a useful mechanistic model of how respiration works. I will skip a lot of details because while it's helpful to know them, they aren't essential.

The central thing we're trying to explain here is: why is it that if you have shortness of breath, the right thing to do is the breathe _less_, even though your body is telling you to breathe _more_? What is going on at the chemical level when people have shortness of breath?

(This is sort of like @cooper2021 on air hunger, but there are a few things I don't like about his explanation, so I'm going to be writing my own ideal version. But if you prefer a video explanation, then you can start with the video and then come back here.)

## Respiration and misconceptions about CO~2~

The chemistry of respiration

What causes the urge to breathe? Humans have what are called chemoreceptors in their brain (and some other places) that tell the body to breathe. How do chemoreceptors know _when_ to breathe? They watch out for signals from the body, in the form of carbon dioxide levels, oxygen levels, and blood pH. Most of the time, when people breathe, it is because the carbon dioxide level increased above some threshold. Oxygen only triggers breathing when it gets really low (so low that I don't think most humans experience it except on very rare occasions). I think blood pH also matters, but maybe only during exercise? (but it might matter more for air hunger; see below).

## Chronic overbreathing and the bicarbonate buffer system

acid--base balance, bicarbonate buffer model

mention how people with shortness of breath might not think they are hyperventilating. For example I don't think I've ever overtly hyperventilated in my life. And yet, I was constantly low-grade overbreathing. @breathingdisordersbookchapter4 [p. 68] says "Hyperventilation tends to persist in many people, and once a pattern of overbreathing is established it can be maintained by only a 10% increase in minute volume, which could be achieved by a combination of deeper breaths, faster breathing, or an occasional sigh".

## The Henderson--Hasselbalch equation and CO~2~ tolerance

[argh, this is kind of hard to explain well. curse of knowledge...]

Okay, so CO~2~ levels (partial pressure?) in the blood regulate breathing. Now let's imagine what happens when someone overbreathes. You might think, okay, CO~2~ goes down, so then you don't get as much of an urge to breathe. That's true in the short term. But if someone _chronically_ overbreathes, then the bodies tries to correct this. You see, the body tries very hard to keep the blood pH at a narrow range of 7.35--7.45. If one chronically overbreathes, then since CO~2~ causes the blood to become acidic, the _lack_ of CO~2~ (you're overbreathing, remember) causes your blood to become too alkaline. So the body compensates by trying to make blood more acidic. How? The kidneys dump out more bicarbonate ($\mathrm{HCO_3^-}$) into the urine. Since bicarbonate is alkaline, getting rid of it makes the blood more acidic. The kidneys don't react immediately; all this happens over the course of hours to roughly 5 days.

[... some more stuff here ...]

The important point is that because of the form of the Henderson--Hasselbalch equation, the more CO~2~ you have, the less sensitive pH is to slight increases in CO~2~. So breath holding for a few seconds does not cause air hunger/panic. Whereas if your CO~2~ is already too low (hypocapnia), then your pH is still normal (thanks to the bicarbonate levels being adjusted by your kidneys), but because of the low CO~2~, even slight changes in CO~2~ can cause large shifts in pH. I think it's this increase in pH that triggers a strong sense of air hunger. If you give in to this urge and breathe, then your pH will be restored, so _temporarily_ you will feel better. But if you keep giving into this urge and breathing more and more, then over time you're shifting down your bicarbonate buffer even more. Your body adjusts. But that means your baseline CO~2~ also keeps decreasing. So now you're _even more_ sensitive to slight increases in CO~2~. It's a vicious cycle. (and this isn't even talking about the negative health effects of low CO~2~.)

Let's look at some numbers.

$$7.4 \approx 6.1 + \log_{10}\left(\frac{24}{0.0307 \cdot 40}\right)$$

above are the values for a normal person.

When I first used a capnometer, my CO~2~ was around 25\ mmHg. So to get the same pH, my bicarbonate level must have been around 15:

$$7.4 \approx 6.1 + \log_{10}\left(\frac{15}{0.0307 \cdot 25}\right)$$

Now let's say both individuals do a breath hold to raise their PCO~2~ by 5\ mmHg. In the case of the healthy person, their pH goes down to 7.34, but in the chronic overbreather's case, it goes down to 7.31.

## Summary

So what we've established is:

- If you have shortness of breath with no clear medical cause, it is likely that your CO~2~ (and thus bicarbonate) levels are too low.
- Low CO~2~ means you are more sensitive to changes in CO~2~, in particular to increases in it. This is why you always feel short of breath.
- The solution is _not_ to "take a deep breath" and get more oxygen, but rather, to breathe _less_ so that you gradually raise your CO~2~ levels. The emphasis is on the word "gradually". If you just hold your breath in the hopes of raising your CO~2~, you will just give yourself a panic attack. The kidneys take time to adjust the bicarbonate levels. So you want to sit with a slight-to-moderate amount of air hunger, over the course of days and weeks, so as to gradually raise your baseline CO~2~. How to do this? We'll discuss breathing techniques and breathing habits more elsewhere in this document.

## Analysis of Howard Cooper videos

What does Howard Cooper's explanation get wrong?

- In the initial video, he doesn't give any mechanism for why people with air hunger are more sensitive to CO~2~ buildup. He just says that it's like people who are sensitive to alcohol.  But why does your level of CO~2~ affect how sensitive you are to buildup of CO~2~? It's completely mysterious.
- In the second video, he tries to give an explanation in terms of the bicarbonate buffer model. The problem is, in his analogy with the water levels, _everything is on an additive scale_. The inferred version of the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation becomes $-\mathrm{pH} = -\mathrm{CO_2} + \mathrm{HCO_3^-}$ ($\text{water level} = -\text{water leaving} + \text{water entering}$). A healthy person and a chronic overbreather will _both_ have the same buildup of CO~2~ when they hold their breath. So why does the chronic overbreather have a lower Control Pause? His model can't explain this. You need to look at the real Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, with the log and fraction, to understand this.


more notes on howard cooper videos:

video 1: [@cooper2021]

(why am i making such a big deal out of his videos? it's because it's the first resource that really made things click for me. it's what got me to start doing breath pauses and nasal breathing. but it wasn't sufficient because it got the theory a bit wrong and also didn't have a good solution other than "do some breath pauses" which i now think are not the most effective way to cure air hunger. so, i want to take the good stuff from this video while also correcting the stuff it got wrong.)

sequence/flow of the video:

- this video is about air hunger and anxiety
- cooper personally had air hunger, and it was real bad
- but people told cooper to do breathing exercises: this just made it worse! being conscious of his breathing made it worse.
- there is a physical cause of air hunger; it's not in your head.
- caveat: but make sure you get checked out by a doctor. the rest of this video assumes you have nothing obviously wrong.
- carbon dioxide: cells take in oxygen and release CO2. when CO2 builds up, you get an urge to breathe.
- anxiety -> overbreathing. "take deep breaths".
- if you have overbreathing for a long time, your CO2 levels go down. your body makes adjustments to the low levels of CO2, and one of these is to become very sensitive to any increase in CO2 [this is WRONG. it's the low level itself that makes you sensitive, not due to any adjustment, as far as i know.]
- alcohol tolerance analogy.
- so what's the cure? gradually expose yourself to more and more CO2, so your body gets used to it.
- "take a deep breath": the worst advice you can give.
- strategies for dealing with air hunger:
  1. sit with the feeling of air hunger, and do shallow breathing.
  2. breathe through your nose. you can even tape your mouth. shoutout to buteyko method.
  3. control pause test introduced. [unfortunately, he doesn't explain it very well. in particular, he doesn't mention that you shouldn't breathe any differently AFTER the test is completed. lol and he even _does it wrong_ in the video by doing an audible inhale after the test!!!] control pause as a marker of your CO2 tolerance.
  4. reduced breathing exercise: you want a manageable amount of air hunger for "a period of time". halve your CP, then do a breath hold for that many seconds, take in some normal breaths, repeat. [i think buteyko people distinguish between reduced breathing and breath holds, and this is a breath hold exercise.] 20 second CP as a marker of normal. exercise while reduced breathing is mentioned. anxiety also improves as CP increases.
  5. avoid ruminating. tell yourself that mild air hunger is ok.

video 2: <https://invidious.slipfox.xyz/watch?v=RLMjvDYJL6Q>

sequence/flow of the video:

- this video is about air hunger.
- check with doctor first.
- CO~2~ isn't all bad -- but doesn't elaborate.
- urge to breathe comes from increase in CO~2~.
- The "sciencey bit":
  - pH of blood is very important. so important that body will prioritize keeping pH in a certain range over keeping you comfortable with your breathing.
  - CO~2~ causes blood to become acidic -> carbonic acid. the big reason your body breathes is to regulate pH.
  - water tank is analogy for pH level (it's actually the "strength of acid" or $-\mathrm{pH}$). water flowing out is CO~2~ being breathed out; 1 tap means normal breathing; 2 taps means you're overbreathing. he then says a confusing thing. he says the water coming from the sink is "a bunch of systems the body has in place to maintain equilibrium". i think this is wrong. what's going on instead is that your body produces more CO~2~ as part of normal metabolic functioning. so that should be what the sink water represents. if you overbreathe, the second tap in the tank opens. water level (acidity) starts to go down. water pitcher = bicarbonate buffer (makes blood more acidic). actually this is the other confusing thing in this analogy. it's not that more bicarbonate is being dumped into the body to make it more acidic -- that would be the opposite, since bicarbonate is alkaline. instead, the body is getting _rid_ of more bicarbonate in the urine, so as to make it _less_ alkaline, aka more acidic. the water level analogy is just too primitive to be able to get all the signs right and i haven't even begun to critique the additive nature of it... But then he shows that if you turn the second tap off, then water level goes up (because the pitcher water is still coming in, as kidneys take time to adjust) = your blood gets more acidic, aka you get air hunger.
  - and THEN he says, after all that, "in other words, your body becomes hypersensitive to any increase in CO~2~". this is the part that is most wrong about this video, although i'm still a bit confused about this. it's true that if the overbreather holds their breath, their water level increases faster than the normal breather's because the pitcher is pouring in extra water. but i think this is not what's happening. the other incorrect interpretation i had was that the inflow and outflow are the same, it's just the bicarbonate levels being different, so both the overbreather and normal breather should have equivalent buildup of CO~2~ in the same amount of time, which wouldn't explain why the overbreather is more sensitive to that same amount of CO~2~ buildup. hmm so actually the water analogy may be more correct that i thought -- the chronic overbreather has to overbreathe to maintain the pH, which means more bicarbonate has to be leaving; the bicarbonate isn't just a static thing, it's also the rate that matters. BUT the bicarbonate levels are essentially static wrt a single breath. so i'm confused. the water analogy is wrong because it shows everything on a similar timescale and on the same additive scale. chronic overbreathing seems to change the bicarbonate levels to a certain extent, but then the bicarb level settles after a while. why? ok maybe what's going on is that each style of breathing has an "equilibrium CO2" level that i goes to. so my old breathing style would go to 25--30mmHg, but breathing in this style forever wouldn't actually lower CO2 more and more, it just asymptotes for some reason. if that's the case, then if you breathe like a normal person or you hold your breath, then it's still not because of the bicarbonate level that you get air hunger more easily; it's still because of the CO~2~ levels. so the howard cooper video is still wrong.
- need to gradually increase CO2 levels.
- anxiety cycle -- being hyperfixated on breathing. anxiety causes you to overbreathe, and you maintain your air hunger, and the air hunger makes you more worried about breathing. so there's a vicious cycle. so need to treat both breathing and anxiety.


# Is healthy breathing the same for everyone?/Is normal breathing universal?

One of the weird things I discovered while using the CapnoTrainer is that the breathing style that brought CO~2~ levels up to normal in the most effortless way turned out to be what the Buteyko people have been saying all along: silent nasal breathing. This raises the question of whether there is some universally "optimal" breathing style that everyone should have, or if it's more of a preference (different people can have different breathing styles, but what matters is that your CO~2~ levels are normal and you don't have air hunger or other breathing issues).

Peter Litchfield on the other hand says that it doesn't matter how you breathe -- you could even mouth breathe -- as long as your breathing habits are "functional" (by which I think he means your CO~2~ levels are at like 40\ mmHg).

# Can you overshoot your CO~2~ levels by doing too much reduced breathing?

so you combat air hunger by breathing less, which raises CO~2~. what if you just keep going? could you be overshooting and getting _hypercapnia_ instead?

Here's a heuristic argument for why this shouldn't happen: even people who overbreathe don't overbreathe so much that their CO~2~ just keeps dropping indefinitely. Each style of breathing seems to asymptote at a certain point. So I think Buteyko-style reduced breathing also asymptotes in terms of CO~2~ levels.

But also, I think there must be some other effect going on, because I don't think the Buteyko people have abnormally high CO~2~ (that's just my current guess).

the main lesson here is that having a capnometer is quite useful, to give the assurance that your CO~2~ levels are normal.

# A short timeline of my improvements

i don't know how representative the speed of my improvements is, but it's the only case i am deeply familiar with, and it might give people an idea of what to expect.

[TODO: add this]


# Sequence of cumulative constraints of breathing practice

I think it may be helpful to conceptualize breathing practice[^kind] not as a set of "breathing techniques" that you practice over time to help calm you down or whatever (such as: "when you're feeling anxious, do square breathing; once you feel comfortable with that, you can move onto different patterns like 4-7-8"), but instead as a *sequence of cumulative constraints*. The reason for having a _sequence_ is that it's too hard to pay attention to the more subtle stuff and get it right all on the first try before you get the basics down; each stage might take a month or more. (The other reason for this particular sequence: if you follow the sequence, then by doing the previous steps, you automatically almost do the next stage, so that at each stage you only need to put in a *little* bit of effort, not invent a whole new thing.) The reason for having *constraints* rather than practices is that it mostly doesn't matter *how* you achieve good breathing, you just want the outcome.

This page used to use the phrase "sequence of moving targets" rather than "sequence of cumulative constraints", but I renamed this page because I thought the new version is a more accurate phrasing. Like the Gram--Schmidt process in linear algebra the constraints are cumulative (at each step $n$, you want to make sure that the new vector you create is orthogonal not just to the $(n-1)$th vector, but to *all* the vectors $1, \dots, n-1$. This kind of mechanic also happens a lot in puzzle games where if you get one thing in a "good" state, and then try to get another thing in a "good" state, the first one will turn back into a "bad" state, and the difficulty of the puzzle is to make sure you can get all the good states cumulatively). Also "constraint" feels more accurate than "target" because you're not trying to hit some new breathing pattern some of the time, but rather you're trying to *only* do the "good" kind of breathing *all* of the time.

[^kind]: By "breathing practice", here I specifically mean breathing practice to cure shortness of breath from over-breathing, but it may also apply to meditative practices as well, I don't know.


## The sequence

Here is the sequence I am thinking of:

1. Initially, because I was still mouth-breathing a significant percentage of the time (20%?), my constraint was to do nasal breathing. _Any_ nasal breathing. The goal was simply to get away from the habit of mouth breathing. Nasal breathing is a good first target because (a) it's extremely obvious whether any particular breath happens through the nose or mouth; and (b) on its own it already has pretty dramatic effects (see James Nestor's book _Breath_ for a lot more detail on this). Achieving nose breathing itself occurs in two stages:
	- Consciously do nasal breathing. You use any and all tools you have to try to nose breathe: just anxiously paying attention all the time, nasal strips, nose cones, azelastine, NeilMed, allergy sheets, etc. (Flonase is another option that _might_ help people but it didn't work for me because of side-effects and there's a chance it builds up a dependence even though it's not supposed to?) You want to get to a point where the only times you mouth breathe are when you have to blow your nose, when you swim, when you take a shower, or things like that. I nose breathe even with a mask on, even when I'm brushing my teeth, and as much as possible even in my sleep (mouth taping might help with this). (This step took around 1 month for me.)
	- Eventually, it becomes automatic, and you won't even need the training wheels. (After a month, my nasal breathing became habitual/automatic. I remained at this stage for the next 4 months or so, not because I wanted to but because I wasn't sure what to do next.)
2. Next stage: silence your breath.
    - Same two stages here (conscious/manual techniques, then unconscious/automatic habit). Silent breath is the next constraint because it's also easy to detect: it means you can't hear your own breath at all (neither inhale nor exhale). Silent breath. At least when you're just sitting or standing. I'm not sure how feasible it is yet to have a silent breath while exercising. (This stage took about a week once I got the CapnoTrainer, though arguably it's still ongoing. In particular, there was a 24 hour period where I had a kind of epiphany and figured out how to do this right.)
    - As with the nose breathing stage, you don't have to get it to be perfect. Sometimes, breathing in a silent way can make your diaphragm or your throat hurt. I think this happens because you're manually trying to control those muscles too hard by tensing them up in the wrong ways. If that's the case, you can try for a while to just make a bit of noise when breathing, just like you might still have "rescue breaths" through your mouth sometimes.
1. Next stage: smooth your breath.
    - Even when your breath is through the nose and silent, it can be "jagged" on the CapnoTrainer. It can even *feel* jagged to you, like you're manually forcing air out in little bursts, instead of it just flowing out like it should. I don't know how to fix this one yet, but it seems harder to notice and harder to fix, so that's why it comes later. But the idea, at least for the exhale, is to just try to let go of the breath and naturally let your diaphragm relax. It should feel like your body is just relaxing, instead of exhaling (even though of course you are also exhaling). As I said, I'm still experimenting with this one.
    - This one is tricky because I notice that as I try to do it my diaphragm can get sore if I do it wrong. In particular, it can sometimes help to break the "silent" rule in order to get the breath smoother. There's a distinction between breathing in a way so that you aren't hypocapnic, and breathing in a way that is comfortable and not painful to your body. Every combination is possible.
2. Next stage: slow down your breath.
    - Your breath should already be slower if it's more quiet and smooth. But when you're trying to make it quiet or smooth, you don't want to focus on slowing it down … that just makes you uncomfortable because you're not used to that much air hunger. But once your breath is silent and smooth, it's time to focus on slowing it down. I still haven't gotten to this stage so I don't know how slow is optimal. I suspect this is the point where an HRV monitor or such would be handy: there might be individual variation in the optimal rate. Notice how it's much harder to say what "slow breath" is compared to "nasal breath" or "silent breath" or "smooth breath", and it is much harder to track without an instrument like a capnometer (counting in your head all the time seems annoying!).

Note that the above is essentially (some of the particular techniques taught in) Buteyko breathing. The differences are: (1) pedagogical, in that I think focusing on each step in sequence works a lot better, and (2) whether to use a CapnoTrainer to help with some of the steps.

## Any more stages?

upper chest (intercostals) vs diaphragm? i feel like this one happens automatically by doing the ones above. But for some reason this is like the focus of many breathing gurus/meditation experts. but it's not necessary!


# Clearing your nose

In my view, nasal breathing is essential for overcoming shortness of breath. It's also the very first step. There's a lot of strategies here so I'll list a bunch along with what I think of them. My guess is that different ones will work for different people, so you kind of want to try a bunch and see what works (most of these are quite cheap).

I won't say much about _why_ it's better to breathe through your nose, as I think this is already covered pretty well in other sources, in particular @nestor2020, which gives a pretty vivid description of the author's own experiment of breathing solely through his mouth (it's scattered throughout the book, so unfortunately I can't cite a specific chapter).

I think there are two broad ways you can react to "you need to clear your nose". One of them will be to say "Yeah, I hardly ever breathe through my nose; I know I need to work on it but I don't know how". The other is to say "I already breathe through my nose; I don't think I need any advice". For this second type of person I want to mention my own anecdote. Before I started really focusing on my breath, I used to think I was already a nasal breather, but when I started paying attention I realized that I was actually taking quite a few mouth breaths throughout the day. A sure way to find out is to tape your mouth during the day (even for just 15 minutes or so) and see how easy it is for you. I think I probably went from around 80% nose breaths to 99.9% nose breaths by following the strategies listed below (just a wild guess unfortunately because I didn't keep good records); during breathing attacks, I probably went from 10--50% nose breaths to 95% nose breaths. So if you already think you are a nasal breather, I would still try paying attention.

Now, here are the main strategies I recommend for clearing your nose so you can nose breathe more:

- Saline spray: works less well than the saline wash, but it's a lot less unpleasant. it doesn't go "deep" enough, which is why it is both less painful and doesn't work as well. i went through about 1.5 bottles of the NeilMed one (lime green color bottle) before my nose improved enough that I didn't need to use it anymore.
- Saline wash/netipot: tried this once. it works really well for clearing your nose, but it was also quite unpleasant. make sure to never use tap water for this.
- Nose strips: these were quite helpful. at first i used the RiteAid brand ones and they worked well enough, and then i got cheaper ones from Amazon and those also worked fine. so my guess is that there isn't much of a quality difference between different brands, and you can just go with whatever. the main thing to watch for is that your skin should not get irritated from using them. also, you should _immediately_ notice an improvement. if you don't immediately breathe better, then you're either not putting them on right or the thing isn't working. There is also a magnetic strip made by a company called Intake Breathing. I never used it so I don't know how well it works, but if you can't get regular nose strips to work, you can look into this.
- Nose cones: these didn't work for me (i got them because i was encouraged by how useful the nose strips were, and cones seemed like reusable strips). they don't go deep enough in the nose, so they really only help i think if you have a deviated septum or something...
- Patrick McKeown's nose unblocking exercise: this is one where you pinch your nose while holding your breath, and swaying or walking around as you do that. I tried this back when my nose was stuffier, and it didn't work very well for me, but i also didn't try very hard to get it working (i just followed one of his videos).
- Antihistamine spray (e.g., azelastine): my guess is azelastine did nothing for me. but maybe it helped a bit with reducing mucus producing during the night. i never tried olopatadine (the more famous antihistamine nasal spray) because my insurance doesn't cover it.
- Steroid spray (e.g. Flonase): i would stay away from these, unless you already know they work well for you. definitely try all the other ones in the list first. note that there are different kinds of steroid sprays and some of them are _very_ bad to keep using long-term. Flonase is supposed to be one of the safer kinds, but i only used it once so i can't speak to any longer-term effects.

Important note: as you start breathing through your nose more, you should find that your nose becomes less blocked even without doing these things. I used to need the nose strips _a lot_ when I first started nasal breathing. But now I hardly need them. So these techniques should be thought of as temporary crutches -- or like training wheels on a bicycle. They are there to help jump start your nasal breathing until your nose is strong enough, but you shouldn't need them forever. I had a clear shift when I first switched to nasal breathing, and then a second shift when I switched to _silent_ nasal breathing. It seems odd that my nose would clear up with _less_ air moving through the nose. My hypothesis is that either my health in general got better, or maybe less air means less irritation.

Definitely don't get surgery, unless you've tried all the safe options and nothing works. I think the mainstream medical world understates the risks here, e.g., you should read about empty nose syndrome. James Nestor's book _Breath_ has a bit about this.

i should say something about mouth taping as well. i don't have any _strong_ argument again it, but i have personally not done it. as you improve your breathing, you mouth should automatically close. so mouth taping is, in my view, unnecessary in the long-term. what about the short term? after all, all the other nose-unblocking stuff i'm recommending are short-term crutches as well. i think in the short term maybe it's completely fine? i was just personally scared of using it, and never needed it.


# On the unreasonable effectiveness of capnometers

One might naively expect that capnometers would be useless, since they don't actually _do_ anything to your breathing. All of the breathing changes you make are ones you make yourself, and the capnometer just tells you what your CO~2~ levels are without affecting them. One might thus conclude that capnometers are useless. I don't have a great reply to this -- in fact, some people seem to get better just by doing Buteyko breathing "blind" (i.e., without seeing their breathing curve using a capnometer). So clearly it _is_ possible to do the same things without a capnometer. (Even Peter Litchfield admits this to some extent.[^capnocourse]) But in my case, it was only after I got a capnometer that I saw rapid progress. Here I will try to build a model of _why_ having a capnometer is so useful.

[^capnocourse]: From the @capnolearningcourse:

    > You may be wondering, "can I benefit from the course without using technology?"  The answer, of course, is a resounding YES.  The ultimate objective of breathing behavior analysis work is NOT about learning to use technology for manipulating breathing with physical techniques, i.e., an outside-in paradigm, but rather it is about learning new breathing habits that automatically optimize respiration, that is, aligning breathing with respiration based on the principles of self-regulation, an inside-out paradigm.  The CapnoTrainer GO technology is a powerful tool for making this transition from an outside-in to an inside-out paradigm, that is, for identifying existing habits and learning new ones.


My model of why capnometers are so "unreasonably effective" is basically that with Buteyko breathing, part of the problem is that even if you make progress, you can never know if you're pushing so hard that you've overshot your CO~2~ and are now having too much CO2. You can't really avoid this problem because both too low CO~2~ and too high CO~2~ feel pretty much exactly the same -- air hunger. So a capnometer is what actually lets you know for sure whether you are undershooting, just right, or overshooting.

It's just super helpful to _see_ what your breath looks like. Buteyko breathing can feel _scary_ because you don't know if you're going too hard and might be harming yourself. Hooking yourself up to a capnometer tells you whether your CO~2~ levels are normal.

# Posture

I'm appreciating posture more now -- it really makes silent relaxed breathing easier when you have better posture. But "good posture" is maybe not what society thinks is good posture, but whatever feels comfortable to you and allows for good breathing.

The Buteyko people also emphasize posture, but I have not read much about what they say.

i still have a lot to learn here. apparently some posture techniques can be quite dangerous (can even cause die-off reactions??)

# Breathing synthesis

[TODO: fill in later]

# Techniques vs habits

One of the disagreements I've seen in the breathing world is the emphasis between techniques vs habits. Those on the techniques side (such as anxiety specialists and Buteyko practitioners) present various techniques you can use when you are stressed, anxious, or have breathing difficulty. Those on the habits side (such as Peter Litchfield) say that techniques are mere bandage covering up a dysfunctional breathing habit, and that the solution is to unlearn the old habits and introduce new habits.

I find myself somewhere in between these two views. In a sense, I think both sides are right, and it's actually quite important to understand what's going on here. Techniques are a way of _learning_ a thing. Once you've learned it, you don't need to "follow a technique" anymore, it's just a part of you. But having it verbally, explicitly, legibly, outlined is a useful step in actually learning the thing initially. You follow the technique, you get anxious about whether you're doing it right, you get obsessed about it, you get good at it, and then finally you get bored of it. It's all part of the _overlearning_ process. Once your bodymind digests it, it poops out the scaffolding of the technique and you can just Do The Thing. See also the four stages of competence [@fourstageswikipedia].

So yes, do the techniques. Learn them so well that you get bored of them and forget about them.
